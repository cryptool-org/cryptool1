1. Brief description of the CrypTool package
   -----------------------------------------
This ReadMe file is part of the free distribution of CrypTool,
a program by means of which cryptographic functions can be easily
demonstrated and known and unknown algorithms can be analyzed.
Already in the ancient ages such methods have been used for privacy
of messages. Current methods are based on modern mathematics and
offer besides encryption also to check integrity, to build digital
signatures, secure authentication and many more. CrypTool supports
both the execution and the analysis of such methods.

CrypTool has been developed by more than 30 persons world-wide
since 1998.

Every part of the program comes with extensive online help, which
can be understood without deep knowledge in cryptography.

CrypTool is completely available in English and German.
The Polish version has the same functionality [at the moment only
the program itself, i.e. the GUI (menus, dialogs, ...) is translated.
The documentation delivered with the Polish version is still in English].

It is required that the user is able to use typical applications
under Windows.

The current release version of CrypTool and the source code are
available at the following internet addresses (without registration):
                http://www.CrypTool.org
                http://www.CrypTool.com
                http://www.CrypTool.de
                http://www.CrypTool.pl

Since mid 2006 about 3000 CrypTool packages are downloaded per
month -- with a growing trend (more than 1/3 of the current downloads
request the English version).

The aim of CrypTool is to explain cryptographic mechanisms and to
demonstrate the use and the limitations of individual mechanisms.
CrypTool has implemented almost all state-of-the-art crypto
functions and allows you to learn about and use, modern and
classic cryptography within the same environment in a "playful"
manner.

CrypTool is used
- within companies to help raising the sensitivity for IT security
  (awareness) and for educational purposes,
- within school lessons and
- within lectures at several universities.

Kindly note the terms of the license and the information regarding
non-liability for any damage arising from the use of CrypTool. These
conditions are described e.g. at the web page, during the installation
process and at the introduction page of the online help for CrypTool.

Previous users of CrypTool may find especially chapter 5 (What's new)
and chapter 6 (Further development) of this ReadMe interesting.

We welcome very much everybody willing to further develop CrypTool
or to give feedback. We are also glad about hints telling us about
papers (diploma or doctor thesis or seminar home works), which could
be integrated into CrypTool. 
Contacts: Please see chapter 9 below.


1.1. How to start - An introduction to CrypTool
     ------------------------------------------
When you start up CrypTool, the CrypTool work area starts up
along with a small welcome screen which appears in the
foreground. If you press F1 in the welcome screen, the starting page
of the online help comes up too.

This starting page is a good starting point, to become acquainted
with all essential features of CrypTool (using the links on this
starting page). Please read the information and the hints on the
introductory help page.

To quickly get up to speed on cryptography with CrypTool, we
recommend that you work through some of the examples (tutorials)
provided within the online help facility (the examples are shown
in the online help contents overview under "Starting work with
CrypTool").

The easiest way to try out many of the CrypTool functions is with
the file "Startingexample-en.txt", which is open by default in the
CrypTool work area. But you also can open any unencrypted file from the
"examples" subdirectory or any other file.

If a menu item has no meaning to you or you don't know exactly what
to do within a dialog window, please press F1. If the according
online help isn't satisfactory please give us feedback.

You can find a 1-page overview over all menus in CrypTool (menu tree)
within the included PDF script (see appendix A1).

We hope you enjoy learning about cryptography and trying out all the
functionality within CrypTool.


1.2. Components of the CrypTool distribution
     ---------------------------------------
The CrypTool package includes the following four main parts:

(1) The program CrypTool
------------------------
Main part of the CrypTool package is the program CrypTool itself.
CrypTool is a demonstration primarily used for training purposes:

- To this end, CrypTool contains an extensive collection of
  cryptographic algorithms and protocols which are well documented
  and partly visualized.
  In this way, CrypTool is very well suited for training and
  teaching employees awareness of the importance of IT security.

- Most of the cryptographic basic algorithms used are taken from:
  - the industry-proven Secude library (http://www.secude.com/),
  - the Miracl library of Shamus Software Ltd (http://indigo.ie/~mscott/),
  - the OpenSSL library (http://www.openssl.org/),
  - the NTL number theory library of Victor Shoup
    (http://www.shoup.net/ntl/),
  - the GMP library for arbitrary precision arithmetic
    (http://www.swox.com/gmp/) and
  - the cv act library of cv cryptovision Ltd (www.cryptovision.com).

  The currently used version of the included libraries can be seen
  within the "About CrypTool" dialog (see help menu).

  In this way, CrypTool is also an outstanding reference
  implementation.

- The cryptanalysis of most of the classical algorithms
  implemented is automated. 
  The analysis of modern techniques is limited so that CrypTool
  is not a hacker's tool.

CrypTool is not intended as an application to be used as a 
Certification Authority (CA) or to encrypt or otherwise protect 
real-world data.


(2) Documentation
-----------------
A comprehensive documentation is provided. This also consists of 
four parts:
a) ReadMe file (this file)
b) online help
   - context-specific help in order to use the program and further
     information about individual topics and principles,
   - demos and sample scenarios (here you learn to know single
     procedures step-by-step).
c) script on the subject of cryptography (attached as a PDF file)
d) presentation, which shows at some slides the possibilities of
   CrypTool (also attached as PDF file).


(3) Self-contained programs
---------------------------
The following programs can be called from within CrypTool or directly
as a stand-alone program:

a) The program AES-Tool v 2.4 (developed within the CrypTool project)
   CrypTool contains a special program for the creation of self-
   extracting executable files. This program can also be used
   independently. In this program a session key is generated from
   a password, and with this key any file's content can be
   AES-encrypted.
   This encryption tool can be called both as a Windows application
   and as a command line tool (e.g. called from within a batch file).
   Files up to 4 GB can be encrypted.

b) The educational game "Number Shark" v 1.1 (by the CrypTool project)
   This game helps pupils to get acquainted with divisors and prime
   factors.

c) The animation program ANIMAL (see http://www.animal.ahrgr.de)
   This program is maintained by Dr. Roessling at the Technical
   University of Darmstadt. It allows to specify and model the single
   steps of algorithms or the components of data structures with as
   much detail as desired, and run these steps forwards, backwards, or 
   automatically). It also can dynamically animate source code.
   Animations can be created with the Animal system using a GUI,
   a script language or a Java API.
   Further examples can be found within the ANIMAL repository: 
   http://www.animal.ahrgr.de/animations.php3?tool=Animal&lang=en

d) The Flash applications "Rijndael" (visualizes the AES encryption
   method) and "Enigma" (visualizes the WW2 crypto machine Enigma).

e) The Authorware application "NT" (Number Theory) introduces elementary
   number theory and visualizes many of the methods and concepts, which
   are the basis of modern public-key cryptography.
   Where appropriate, the mathematical formulas are shown.
   It allows to dynamically check out the mathematical methods with own
   number examples.
   Part of it is the program bc.exe by Free Software Foundation,
   which allows to alculate with arbitray precision from the commandline.



(4) Stories dealing with number theory and cryptography 
-------------------------------------------------------
There are two stories attached as PDF file.
- In "The Dialogue of the Sisters" the title-role sisters use a 
  variant of the RSA algorithm, in order to communicate securely.
- In "The Chinese Labyrinth" Marco Polo has to solve number theoretic
  problems to become a minister of the Great Khan.

All the single files included in the package are listed within
chapter 4 (see below in this ReadMe file).



1.3. Acknowledgements
     ----------------
A big number of individuals have contributed to CrypTool, many of
them in their free time as well (some are listed in the dialog
box you get after double clicking the "About" dialog box).
We are extremely grateful to them.

Sponsors are e.g. Deutsche Bank AG and the Technical University
of Darmstadt.

Without being complete we want to mention some contributors and their
eventual special conditions here:

- Dr. Carsten Elsner allowed us to include both his stories.
  The author owns all rights at these stories. The maintainer of
  CrypTool is allowed by the author only to distribute this story
  together with the CrypTool package.
  The German version of the story "The Dialogue of the Sisters"
  was first published in the computer magazine c't, 25/1999. While 
  c't published a slightly shortened version you here get the original
  version.

- Dr. Guido Roessling allowed us. to include and deliver his freeware
  ANIMAL, a Java based animation software.

- We also got the allowance to integrate enhanced versions of:
  - the Flash animation for AES by Enrique Zabala,
  - the Flash animation for Enigma by Dr. Frank Spiess,
  - the number theory e-learning program by Martin Ramberger.
  All rights for a usage outside the free context of CrypTool
  application remain with the appropriate owners/authors.

- The companies (See chapter 1.2)
  - Secude IT Security Ltd, 
  - Shamus Software Ltd and
  - cv cryptovision Ltd
  allowed us gratefully to use their cryptographic libraries.
  These libraries distributed with CrypTool are not allowed to be
  used in another context than CrypTool without contacting the
  mentioned companies and asking for their current terms of licence.

Also we want to cordially thank the open source developers, who
encouraged us with their code or who build code we can use
(e.g. the libraries OpenSSL, GMP und NTL, the installation software
NSIS, the text editor software Scintilla).

I also want to thank Mr. Bartosz Sawicki from the university of
Warsaw, who did with his team the complete Polish version.


1.4. Maintainer and Hosting
     ----------------------
Since October 2002 the chair "Security in Information Technology", 
faculty computer science from Mrs. Prof. Dr. Claudia Eckert at the
Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany hosts the English and 
German web page of CrypTool and the Subversion repository system
for the program sources.

The CrypTool developer group around Bernhard Esslinger continues
to act the maintainer: This means they take care about the source
code, they publish CrypTool as open source and freeware, and they
co-ordinate the further development. Current steps of the roadmap
are also published at the web page.

Homepage of CrypTool: www.cryptool.com  (www.cryptool.org).

We would be very glad about every new developer, who joins to help
to enhance the functionality and usability of CrypTool.
Ideas for further development can be found in chapter 3.

Also very welcome are ideas and information, how CrypTool is used in
lectures, school and education, so that we can help to share this
information.



2. What does CrypTool offer in detail
   ----------------------------------

2.1. What can you do with CrypTool
     -----------------------------
The general properties and functions of CrypTool are:

- E-learning program around the topic cryptography and cryptanalysis.

- Everything in one program package and controlled by one common 
  graphical user interface.

- CrypTool is fully available in both English and German.
  The program itself also available in Polish.

- Many classical encryption methods, and for them either a manual
  cryptanalysis or an automatic analysis is offered (known-plaintext attack).

- Codes like Base64 and UU-Encode.

- Almost all modern symmetric encryption methods, accompanied by brute-force
  analysis
  (The brute-force attack on symmetric algorithms allows to define
   joker characters and the expected elapsed time is displayed. 
   Additionally you can customize the width of the entropy field
   used for this kind of analysis within the analysis options).

- Modern (asymmetric) crypto methods and protocols (hash, RSA, ECC, digital
  signature, hybrid encryption, PKCS#5, shared secret, ...) and partly
  attacks against it (birthday attack, side-channel attack, 
  lattice-base reduction).

- Demonstration of the RSA cryptosystem (and some variants) and some
  number theoretic algorithms behind:
  - Generate and test primes (including the deterministic method AKS).
  - Factorize numbers (step-by-step) with different methods
    (the different methods run in parallel threads).
  - Make the RSA cryptosystem understandable and use it:
     - Generate RSA keys (also with primes of your own choice).
     - Encrypt/decrypt with RSA.
     - Generate RSA signatures and validate these.
     - Attack the RSA cryptosystem.

- Three attacks against RSA, based on lattice reduction. They work,
  if special preconditions are given:
  * either a part of one of the two factors of N is known 
    ("Factoring with a Hint"),
  * or a part of the cleartext of an eavesdropped encrypted message
    is known and e is small ("Attack on Stereotyped Messages"),
  * or if d is too small compared to N, N can be factorized 
    ("Attack on Small Secret Keys (according to Bloemer/May)").
  This implementation was done within a thesis, which can be delivered
  via email (this thesis only exists in the German language).

- Visualization / Animation / Demonstration
  - demo of the sensitivity of hash algorithms.
  - visualization via flow process charts (e.g. the Diffie-Hellman
    key exchange protocol or the challenge response demonstration).
  - Animations
     - with ANIMAL (e.g. DES) or
     - with Flash (AES, Enigma).
     - with Java/SWT: Addition of points on an elliptic curve (both on
                      discrete as on real curves).

- Demonstration for different ways of authentication in the net
  (Visualisation of challenge response methods):
  * from UID/PW and One-Time-Password
  * over (unidirectional) challenge response (symmetric + asymmetric)
  * to asymmetric mutual authentication.
  * The user interactively can control, what a attacker could do
    (get the computer under control, create or separate connections,
     eavesdrop).
  * Experience: only the mutual asymmetric authentication is secure
    against man-in-the-middle attacks.

- Demonstration for a side-channel attack against a typical hybrid
  encryption protocol: If the implementation is not comprehensive,
  but formally correct, as happened in reality, the attacker can very
  efficiently calculate the used session key of an eavesdropped message
  by sending protocol-appropriate requests to the server.

- Calculate hash values and demonstrate its sensitivity.

- Implementation of MACs (combination of hashes and symmetric methods
  to authenticate messages). 
  Hashes have been already used in CrypTool within PKCS#5 or digital
  signatures.

- The Shared Secret method from Shamir has been implemented with
  many options.

- Random numbers:
  - generators and statistical analysis for (random) data (e.g. FIPS-140-1).
  - The Secude cryptographic random number generator allows to gather
    entropy by mouse moves and keyboard entries.
    This is the default, when calling it the first time, because it shows,
    that you need a random source in order to get good random data.
  - 3-D visualisation of big sets of random numbers with the rendering
    engine from OpenQVis (http://openqvis.sourceforge.net/).

- Export and import RSA and DSA-PSEs with the keys stored in there
  via PKCS#12.

- The modern methods are implemented according to international
  standards (reference implementation).

- The last adjustment for a method (parameter, key or alphabet) is
  stored within the program. A stored key can be retrieved via an
  insert-key-icon for any single key, which make the handling of testing
  and probing easier.  

- For each window you now can call a dialog which shows all relevant
  properties of the document.

- All persistent data is now stored within the user local part of
  the registry (no more INI file): So CrypTool can be used without
  administrator access rights and different users at the same pc can
  have different settings.

- The same menu structure now permanently visible: Items which cannot
  be clicked for special document types are dynamically made grey,
  but they are no more taken away (this was a frequent request from
  users).

- The self-contained program AES-Tool can create self-extracting
  programs. So you can encrypt any file <4 GB with the AES algorithm,
  protected by a password (entered as a hexadecimal key).
  Full functionality also when calling from the command line.

- The self-contained e-learning program about the mathematics behind the
  asymmetric cryptography presents exhaustively and interactively the
  elementary number theory.

- Three applications based on the Chinese remainder theorem:
  * Solving a system of linear modular congruencies using the solar
    system as an example.
  * Showing how you can calculate (add, subtract or multiply) with
    modular remainders (residues) instead of the (bigger) actual
    numbers.
  * Showing the shared secret method (this is an electronic equivalent
    to the vault mechanism where e.g. at least 3 key-owners must 
    cooperate to open it, but 5 different keys are there).

- The educational game "The Number Shark" helps pupils to
  get an easy understanding of divisors and primes.

- Web page with the hash values of all downloadable CrypTool files:
  So you can check the integrity of the files of the CrypTool package
  stored on your computer.

- Exhaustive documentation (online help, script).
  The online help has HTML format.
  The online help contains explanations about the handling and about all
  the cryptographic methods, a historic overview and the integration into
  further scientific and organisational topics plus how cryptography should
  be used.

- CrypTool is used world-wide in schools, universities, agencies and
  companies.

- The source code of the release version can be downloaded from
  the CrypTool webpage.
  Read access to the current developer sources is possible via:
  svn checkout https://file.sec-tud.de/svn/CrypTool/trunk
       --username anonymous --password anonymous

You can get a good overview of what CrypTool offers
- at the attached Powerpoint presentation
   (title: "Cryptography with CrypTool") and
- at the web site of CrypTool 
   (use the item "CT Introduction" within the left frame) or
- within the online help (see "starting page").



2.2. What's new in version 1.4.10
     ----------------------------
Chapter 2.2 lists the enhancements and bug fixes in CrypTool 1.4.10,
which have been added since CrypTool 1.4.00.

a) Developer-relevant changes (more technically oriented):

- Details about compilation, linking and about a consistent development
  can be found in the sources in the file "readme-source".

- The sources have been compiled with Microsoft development environment
  Visual Studio 2003 (VC++ v7.1).

  There is already a source branch in the Subversion system, which can
  be compiled with VS2005 (VC++ v8.0). This will be officially 
  supported later.

- The editors used for text and binary are open-source:
  * Hex editor / Hex control / HexView:
    Link: http://www.codeguru.com/Cpp/controls/controls/article.php/c5287
    Added: - Insertion and copying distinguishes between ASCII and
             hex coding.
    In the hexadecimal editor currently no search is available.
  * Text editor:
    Link: http://scintilla.sourceforge.net/ScintillaDownload.html
    Added: - You can highlight, which characters belong to the
             actual alphabet.
           - Search and Replace now supports regular expressions. xxxxxxxxxx

- From 1.4.10 NSIS is used as installation tool
  (see http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page).



b) Changes within the user documentation:

- Online help: improved, strongly enhanced, index structured newly.

- Within the script: minor bug-fixes, small enhancements, some updating
  (e.g. record in solving a concrete discrete-logarith problems), new
  chapter about the future of cryptography by the research
  faculty of Prof. Buchmann.

- Updated and enhanced presentation (almost 100 pages now).



c) New functionality:

- Bugfixes:
  - Many small improvements in the masks (user interface),
    e.g. now all key entry dialogs for the classic methods contain a
    button for the text options, where you can select the used alphabet.
    This connection is also offered in the analysis mask for
    calculating n-grams (there before a fixes alphabet was used).
  - Calculation of the hash value of a file: Race condition eliminated.
  - Solitaire corrected for a special case (if the output card was a
    joker, it was not spent).
  - Rijndael corrected for key length > 128 bit.

- The AES-Tool in version 2.4 checks, that the given key is not longer
  than 256 bit ist. Additionally now you can draw via the mouse a file
  from the Windows Explorer into the entry field for the file to be
  encrypted.

- The key entry dialogs for the classical methods now contain a button
  so you can from here directly change the alphabet (text option) if it
  does make sense.

- The Hill encryption scheme has been enhanced with some variants:
  - Customizable are now the matrix multiplication (from left or right)
    and the value of the first letter of the alphabet. 
  - The key matrix can be entered not only by letters but also by
    integers.
  - The log file (detailed output) to explain the scheme now is more
    explicit. Additionally the first letters from the cleartext are used
    dynamically (instead of using a fixed string).

- New within the set of modern symmetric encryption methods are the
  DES variants DESX (Rivest), DESL and DESXL (Ruhr University Bochum).

- Elliptic curve methods are now used not only in signatures but also
  with the hybrid encryption (Ecc-AES).
  Additionally there is a demonstration about addition of points on an
  elliptic curve (both on discrete as on real curves).

- The educational program/game "Number Shark" was enhanced a bit.

- New are the Flash animations for AES and Enigma.

- Also new is a Authorware e-learning program, which explains and visualizes
  methods of the elementary number theory.



3. Possible areas for further development -- ideas, requests
   ---------------------------------------------------------

3.1. Functionality: Algorithms / methods
     -----------------------------------
- Implement additional algorithms on each topic:
    * Codes:
       - T9
    * Encryption:
       - Classic procedures: Turning grille (Fleissner) (incl. analysis).
       - Symmetric procedures:
           Camellia (RFC3713), RC5 and Gost (http://vipul.net/gost).
       - Public key methods: McEliece, Rabin, NTRU.
       - Demonstration of visual cryptography.
    * Hashes:
       - SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512
         http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-2/fips180-2.pdf
       - Tiger (http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~biham/Reports/Tiger/)
    * Protocols / weaknesses in protocols:
       - Visualisation of man-in-the-middle attacks.
       - Blind signatures.
       - Electronic voting.
       - Tripartite key exchange.

- Offer fast selection between different encryption methods using a
  dialog box instead of using menus (and making all parameters of these
  algorithms customizable) (see CryptoBench).

- Generate cryptographically strong elliptic curves and use these
  to implement a cryptosystem based on elliptic curves.
  Here, one could take the cryptosystem developed by Menezes and
  Vanstone that was proposed by the authors in 1993:
  A. Menezes and S. Vanstone,
  "Elliptic curve cryptosystems and their implementation",
  Journal of Cryptology, 6 (1993), pp 209-224.

- Hill cipher
   - enable to transpose the key matrix

- Because cryptographic structures and formats are often ASN.1
  encoded: Integration of an ASN.1 decoding tool.

- Random numbers:
  - In Germany evaluations of deterministic random number generators
    are based on AIS 20 (since December 1999; AIS = Application
    Notes and Interpretation of the Scheme) and evaluations of 
    physical random number generators are based on AIS 31 (since
    September 2001). Especially AIS 31 has achieved great interest
    outside of Germany: this scheme evaluates not only the quality
    of the output like FIPS-140, but also the design of the generator
    itself !
    The documents AIS 20 and AIS 31 are both in English and German
    available at the web page of the German GISA:
    http://www.bsi.bund.de/zertifiz/zert/interpr/ais20e.pdf   
    http://www.bsi.bund.de/zertifiz/zert/interpr/ais31e.pdf   
    http://www.bsi.bund.de/zertifiz/zert/interpr/trngk31e.pdf 
    It would be a meaningful enhancement of CrypTool, to implement
    these requirements on evaluating random number generators 
    and also to visualize them.

- Implement further standards and refer to all places, where
  they (e.g. PKCS#5) are used, from a menu and from the online
  help (main task here is user interface and documentation).

- Reveal the link between CrypTool (PKCS#12) and PGP by enabling the
  use of PGP keys within CrypTool.
    Idea: Open private key ring via a given password, analyse its 
    structure, get the private key (PGP sources are available) and 
    use this key, to decrypt PGP files with the algorithms implemented
    in CrypTool. This shows, that PGP also only uses standard algorithms.

- Usage of CrypTool as a demonstrator for XML signatures.

- Visualize the password quality with a password quality meter.



3.2. Functionality: Analysis
     -----------------------
- It would be especially desirable if analysis in all forms and its
  visualization could be enhanced.

- Offering a (good) analysis for all encryption methods (which is at
  least for the classic methods better than brute-force). 

- Attack on symmetric encryption methods, where you have the flexibility
  to reduce the parameters of the encryption method.

- Differential cryptanalysis on symmetric ciphers (DES, ...).

- Enhance the brute-force possibilities: Use knowledge about
  - parts of the cleartext
  - parts of the key.

- Analysis to be newly implemented for:
   * homophone encryption
   * permutations/transpositions
   * Playfair encryption
      - pure C sources from Gunnar-Andresson are available.

- Analysis to be improved for:
   * mono-alphabetic substitution
      - explicitly show mutually inverted digrams like "th"/"ht" and
        double-characters like "tt".
      - Show the characters which have been substituted not only 
        capitalized but also in red to enhance readability.
   * Use word lists (dictionary) for all attacks, not only for the
     substitution.

- Usage of algorithms from the area of AI (artificial intelligence) and
  GP/GA (Genetic Programming/Algorithms) in order to analyse automatically
  (classical) encryption ciphers.

- Mass pattern search: Implementation of an enhanced high performance
  pattern search for pre-given standardized and regular patterns of any
  size (e.g. in order to find multiple patterns in one file which are 
  also there in another file), or which searches for unknown but
  repeated patterns in a document.
  The search could be enhanced by additionally offering replacing.

- Search for patters using norms (i.e. "together" = 12341546).
  C sources are available.

- Facilities for correcting individual characters in the analysis
  of XOR, ADD, Vigenère. Ignorance of non-encrypted areas.

- Display of second-, third-, etc. -best hit in XOR/ADD analysis
  (this could lead to a shorter key length).

- Autocorrelation: Execute further operations (XOR, ADD, ...) in the
  blocks prior to super imposition, if appropriate.

- Make it possible to edit the homophone key (necessary for the
  analysis of homophone encryption).

- Floating entropy: automatic display of relevant places with
  high entropy.

- Illustrate the Vigenère analysis more deeply:
  - Enable to enter not only a fixed value for the key length,
    but also a range of values (e.g. "2-9"). Then show in the next
    dialog for each length the statistically most appropriate
    key. Eventually show the top-10 most likely keys for a given length.
    Clicking at the displayed key proceeds the according
    decryption. Clicking an additional button performs the
    decryptions for all displayed keys.
  - The analysis option "Show base ciphers" currently shows for
    each "column Caesar" the graphics correlation and histogram.
    Additionally the text for each column Caesar could be
    displayed.

- Timing Attack on RSA / Advantages of blinding.

- Visualize current hash attacks (create postscript documents according
  to Lucks or PDF documents according to BSI with the same hash value)
  and explain the  scenarios.

- Attack on the WEP protocol.

- Implement and/or visualize further attacks against concrete protocols
  in order to improve future concepts.




3.3. Internal interfaces / editors
     -----------------------------
- Summary of all display modules in a logical class tree.

- Offer a view for any text file to show them in any given fixed
  block length: e.g. formats xxx xxx xxx  or  xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx ...

- Rearrange the source to facilitate a separation of cryptographic
  functions from the user interface (make ports and debugging easier).

- Enable customisation wherever possible:
  Offer an option to set e.g. initial vector, number of rounds, key
  length, word size or the kind of padding (e.g. for the RC5 algorithm,
  see RFC2040).
  Then these additional customisations must become part of the
  format for the internal key storage.

- Libraries for arbitray length numbers and cryptography:
   - Support further libraries (LiDIA, FLINT/C, Wei Dai's Crypto++, ...)

- Extend existing limitations of the N-Gram analysis concerning
  the file size (evtl. give user feedback and allow to stop calculation,
  if a high amount of time is necessary).


3.4. User interface / visualizations
     -------------------------------
- There are several dialogs within CrypTool where special input fields
  expect a special number format (decimal, hexadecimal, ...).
  The dialog "The RSA Cryptosystem" e.g. allows to enter the message
  as text (with an alphabet defined by you) or as a number (with 4
  different base numbers); compared with that the primes here can 
  only be entered as decimal numbers or as terms of decimal numbers.
  It would be useful if a calculator can be called from within 
  CrypTool as an a-modal window: it should accept terms with numbers 
  of any basis as input and it should show the result in several
  fields in parallel with different number bases. 
  The right output number representation could be transferred into
  the clipboard via button, or the mouse could drag the field content
  directly into the entry field in the CrypTool dialog box.

- Offer a customizing feature to the user, so that he can choose that
  all new windows appear within the main windows (as right now) or
  as "free" (modal or a-modal) windows outside the main window.
  E.g. show single dialogue windows in an a-modal way (e.g. N-gram
  analysis, manual analysis, hybrid encryption demonstration).
  This allows that one can switch between the main window and
  the dialogue window without closing the dialogue window first
  (the burden is a more complex control mechanism, handling of
  multiple calls to the same dialogue, update after change of
  window focus or after changing the underlying original data
  within the main window, ...).

- AES-Tool:
  - Integrate the PKCS#5 dialog to let the user enter letters in
    his used way: then set random values for salt and iteration
    counter and ask the user, to remember the generated hex value
    or store it securely. 
  Generally within CrypTool the keys of modern encryption methods
  intentionally must be typed in using the hex format. 
  We pedagogically did it by will, that everybody sees what type of
  key the different methods expect: classical methods expect a key
  built from the used alphabet, modern symmetric methods expect 
  binary data of key length 56 bit till 256 bit.
  On the other hand people normally are used to type their input using
  all ASCII keyboard buttons. Within a productive application the key
  should NOT be built of ASCII-letters. If it is wished to use a ASCII
  password then it is better to generate a good key from the password. 
  Within CrypTool both requirements (key input via ASCII and showing,
  that good hex-keys are necessary) could be combined in the
  following way:
  Within the hexadecimal key input dialogs a button should be added,
  calling the dialog "Indiv. Procedures \ Hash \ Key Generation from
  Password (PKCS#5)". 
  The called dialog then is already customized with the right key length
  and after pushing "Back" the generated key will be used as hex 
  input for the encryption method. In order to make this also work
  for AES-256, the hash function SHA-256 must be added to the 
  "Key Generation from Password"-dialog.

- Make customizable by the user how big the part of text and binary
  files can be which CrypTool will load.

- New magnification function in the display for graphics and/or
  display of co-ordinates of the current mouse pointer position.

- Visualization:
   - Visualization of dependencies and workflows in protocols 
     (not only "simple" algorithms) is a meaningful enhancement.
   - Attacks on weak RSA keys are described in CrypTool's 
     online help at Help \ Scenarios \ RSA cryptosystem (demonstration),
     under the topic "3. Attack on the RSA algorithm", which explains
     that factorisation of the module can break the method.
     This is implemented, but not visualized.
   - Attacks on other asymmetric methods are not implemented in
     CrypTool yet. To attack Diffie-Hellman, DSA or EC-DSA, one 
     has to calculate "discrete logarithms". After implementing
     this it also could be visualized.


3.5. Porting to Linux, Java and VS2005/WPF
     -------------------------------------

- Wish list for a future version (2.0):
  - All languages supported by one program, one setup.
  - More modern layout.
  - More user interaction, action history.
  - Dynamic change between crypto providers and languages.
  - Updates of partial functionality via the internet.
  - Implementation of more functions as threads.
  - Easier handling of cascade using the existing building blocks.
  - Offer a recorder for user interactions.

- Porting to Linux using GCC 4.x and Qt 4.x.
   - The libraries from Secude, Miracl, NTL, OpenSSL and GMP are
     available.
   - Divide the complete task in meaningful parts:
       - graphical user interface: This is the main task.
       - functionality implemented in pure C/C++: ok
       - online help in HTML: ok.
   - At the moment there are only first tries.

- Completely new designed CrypTool in Java (JCrypTool JCT):
   - A major sub project, which does the port
   - A Secude library, Bouncy Castle and FlexiProvider are available.
   - Usage of Eclipe, SWT and Jigloo for development.
   - Plug-in based architecture.
   - Further developers for this project are very welcome.
   - First concepts and sources are available.
   - The current developers here use SourceForge with Subversion for
     source code version management: http://jcryptool.sourceforge.net/ .

- Porting to Windows Vista using Visual Studio 2005 and .NET.
  Usage of the new GUI API Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
  to create multi media GUIs.
   - Usage of the .NET framework (no MFC any more).
   - Usage of VS2005 (no longer VS2003),
     aiming to build the whole project with the free-of-charge
     express edition for C++/C#.
   - A prototype is already available in an extra source branch
     in the CrypTool subversion repository, where everyone has read
     access using the user "anonymous".
   - Further developers and ambitious graphical designers are more
     than welcome in this new project.




3.6. Meaningful tasks to make the new maintainer familiar with
     ---------------------------------------------------------
- Integration of further classic methods like e.g. autokey, Nihilist
  or Enigma (without visualization).

- Integrate the RC5 algorithms as described above, in order to
  see all places where to enhance the sources (function itself,
  options, menus + status line info, online help, ...).

- Offer all kind of transpositions and superpositions for the
  content of text windows in an easy-to-use dialogue window.

- Show in a dialog all keys which are saved for the different
  encryption methods.

- Pattern matching dialogs.

- Create a test suite with examples and solutions, in order to
  automate testing and to make sure, that program changes do not
  negatively influence old and running functionality:
  a) interface, to load test cases manually into the dialog boxes
  b) interface, to load test cases from a file into the different
     dialog boxes.
     Maybe build a script language to control all dialogues or
     use automated test tools off-the-shelf.
  c) create command line interface (best after within the source
     pure crypto functionality is separated from user-interaction)
     so test cases can be read from a file without using
     dialog boxes (without user interface), solved and the result
     again written to a file:
     -> automatic comparison of the solution possible
     -> new version can be tested easier.




4. Limitations and requirements
   ----------------------------

4.1. Scope of this Education, training and awareness software
     --------------------------------------------------------
CrypTool is a demonstration primarily for training and awareness
purposes, which is intended to be used at once without any previous
configuration work.

Therefore the development goal of CrypTool was not to be used
productively for encryption or as a Certification Authority (CA) --
despite the functions are correctly implemented in CrypTool.

For instance - contrary to productive CA applications - the CA key pair
is contained directly within the software (source and binary) and
it is protected with a very simple PIN for the CA-PSE (personal 
security environment).

The root key of the CA built in CrypTool 1.4.10 has a length of 2048
bit and it is valid for 20 years (July 6th, 2006 - July 6th, 2026).
Certificates issued with the root key of older CrypTool versions 
(1.3.05 and older) cannot be imported in version 1.4.10.

Please notice when creating user certificates with CrypTool, that each
CrypTool program contains a root CA with the same key pair. 
This means that everybody (!), who uses CrypTool, can sign user 
certificates with this built-in CA.

Professional PKI software like the OpenXPKI, Entrust, the Secude CA or
the Microsoft CA additionally manage the whole certificate life-cycle,
offer CRL handling, take care for unique serial numbers and use
defined registration processes.

Nevertheless all the modern crypto algorithms in CrypTool are
implemented according to international standards and are working
as "well" as in productive applications.


4.2. Win32 environment and roadmap
     -----------------------------
CrypTool requires a Win32 environment.

Some funcions require an installed Java Runtime Environment (>= version 1.4).

The computer equipment should have at least a 300 MHz CPU, 256 MByte RAM,
and 40 MByte free space on the hard drive (low requirements).

CrypTool 1.4.10 support Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Vista.

CrypTool doesn't need administrator access rights - neither for the
installation nor for the usage.

Persistent data is written only into the CrypTool directory, into
the Windows directory for temporary files (TEMP directory) or into
the user specific part of the Windows registry (Details see
chapter 3) (There are mo INI files used any more).

Remark: Where the TEMP directory of Windows is, can be seen by
entering %TEMP% in the Windows Explorer. The value can also be seen
and adjusted under Windows XP via "System --> System properties 
--> Tab Enhanced --> Environment variables".

CrypTool also works basically under FreeBSD/Linux with Wine
(with reservations on functionality and stability).
See appendix 11.1.

Future goals are to port CrypTool to Linux or Java, and to create a
version 2.0 using Windows WPF (see chapter 3.5).


4.3. Interactive online help under Windows XP
     ----------------------------------------
Using Windows XP there is a special case where it is not
possible to get the online help via F1: Only menu entries with
submenus are affected. The problem only occurs while the submenu
is displayed. In this case pressing F1 has no effect.

Usually you can also help in CrypTool also for selected menu items
which itself have submenus -- independent of whether the submenu 
is popped up or not.
Under Windows XP you only get the online help, if the submenu
is not popped up.
With other versions of Windows this doesn't matter - there it is
only important, that the menu has the focus.

Workaround with example: 
Select the menu item "Indiv. Procedures \ RSA Cryptosystem":
If the submenu of "RSA Cryptosystem" pops up, but you want to
get help for the menu item "RSA Cryptosystem" itself, only
under Windows XP you have to close the submenu of
"RSA Cryptosystem" using the Esc or the left arrow key, and then
press F1.


4.4. Support for different languages
     -------------------------------
Program, help facility and the documentation are designed to run
in more than one language (currently in English and German).

The current Polish program has all its menus and dialogs in Polish.
Help system and documentation are still added in English (this will
change till end of 2007).

For each supported language we deliver at the moment an extra setup.


4.5. Restrictions / Features
     -----------------------
- In order to demonstrate the RSA cryptosystem and to factorize
  integers CrypTool uses the long integer arithmetic of the Miracl
  library from Shamus Software Ltd. We restricted the integer bit
  length up to 8192.

- From binary files "only" the first almost 2 GB can be loaded into
  the hex editor (< 0x7ffff000 = 2.147.479.552 Bytes).
 
  In contrast text files can be loaded in unlimited size by the text
  editor (if you got enough resources on your pc).

- Reading and saving text file always uses the two characters CR/NL
  (so usual under Windows) to characterize the begin of a new line.
  This means that documents you get from unix, where a new line is
  characterized only with the character LF) are getting longer [LF
  is changed into CR/NL]. So the validation of a signature could fail.

- Display of special mathematical characters within the HTML help:
  Microsoft's HTML-Help calls the predefined Microsoft Internet Explorer
  (IE). Version IE 6 sometimes has problems, to display mathematical
  characters like the Gauss bracket.
  If your computer has IE7 as predefined Microsoft browser, the it
  works ok.
  The basic HTML files, which are aggregated within the CHM file are
  displayed correct with IE7 and Firefox 1.5 and 2.0.
  Within the online help chapter about the modulo operator the Gauss
  bracket is used to describe the next lower integer.

- For performance reasons it was decided that CrypTool limits the
  document size when performing n-gram analysis:
   - for binary data up to 64 kByte and
   - for text data up to 256 kByte.
  Files opened, which are longer, are truncated -- only in this
  special analysis -- to the maximal length.

- Hash values of external files, which are not loaded into the internal
  editor, can be calculated for files of any size. 

- With the AES-Tool you can encrypt and archive files with a
  maximum size of 4 GB (as long as compiled with VS2003).

  Please keep in mind, that the output of the stand-alone AES-Tool
  is not identical with the output you get within CrypTool, using
  the menu item sequence "Crypt/Decrypt \ Symmetric (modern) \ 
  Rijndael (AES)"  (even if you create a file with has the extension
  "aes"). CrypTool itself currently uses a fixed IV (0), which is
  not stored. AES-Tool uses a random IV, which is appended together 
  with the file name to the end of the encrypted data.


4.6. Using certificates created with older CrypTool versions
     -------------------------------------------------------
If you want to keep on using certificates, created with CrypTool versions
older than 1.4.00, you can do so:
  a) for RSA and DSA keys:
     Export the PSEs with the old CrypTool into a PKCS#12 format and
     load these files into the new CrypTool.
  b) for ECC keys:
     Here it is enough, to copy the according files
     (e.g. [da][db][EC-prime239v1][1131039030][d] )
     from the old CrypTool\pse directory into the new one.



5. Installation / de-installation / operating
   -----------------------------------------

5.1. Installation and further usage of keys of previous versions
     -----------------------------------------------------------
To install CrypTool on your PC, copy the CrypTool setup executable
to a suitable place in the file system and double-click on it.
The default target directory is "C:\Program Files\CrypTool".
The target directory can be altered in the installation routine.

If you already possess an earlier version of CrypTool, it is
recommended uninstalling the old version of CrypTool before
installing the new one, as otherwise it is possible that some
of the old files will not be overwritten. Please note:
- During de-installation not all of the directories and files in
  the program directories (normally "C:\Program Files\CrypTool")
  may be deleted. If so, delete these manually.
- De-installation will delete all user generated asymmetric keys.
  If you intend to further use those keys also in the newly installed 
  version of CrypTool, then perform the following steps. Copy the
  entire pse\ directory in order to protect these keys. De-install
  CrypTool and install the new version. Finally copy the saved
  pse\ directory to the installation folder. Also see chapter 4.6.
  Alternatively you can export/import RSA and DSA PSEs using the 
  PKCS#12 format.

Please note that it might be necessary to adjust the access
permissions if multiple users want to share one CrypTool
installation. In that case set the access rights in the
sub-trees "pse\" and "pse\pseca\" to full access for each user.

The "pse\" sub-tree should not be manually altered as, if the
structure becomes inconsistent, it may be necessary to completely
reinstall CrypTool in order to use the certificate based methods.


5.2. Installation under multi-user operating systems
     -----------------------------------------------
In multi-user systems like Windows XP the administrator has full
access to the whole file system; the other users are normally
restricted.

If a normal user installs CrypTool he needs write access for the 
directory in which CrypTool should be installed:
- e.g. for the directory %ProgramFiles% (normally C:\Program Files),
  if the sub-directory "CrypTool" does not already exist; or
- for the directory  %ProgramFiles%\CrypTool (C:\Program Files\CrypTool),
  if this already exists.
If he does not have these rights, the installation program stops.

Therefore as a normal user without admin access rights, you should specify
as target directory a so called "local directory" (instead of "C:\Programme").
"Local" and accessible for any user could be e.g.: %ALLUSERSPROFILE%
(The default of the English Windows XP is: 
"C:\Documents and Settings\All Users").

If you install CrypTool without administrator rights and you also have no
write access to %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Start Menu, then the CrypTool specific
entries are missing in the start menu of WXP ("Start \ All Programs").
But every user can add these entries manually.

Remark: In the same way as with %TEMP%, you can see, where these directories
are on your disk by entering in the Windows Explorer %ALLUSERSPROFILE% or
%userprofile%.


5.3. De-installation of CrypTool
     ---------------------------
To de-install use the "Start" menu entry in the windows task bar.
Go for "All programs" \ "CrypTool".
Click "Uninstall CrypTool".


5.4. Operating under multi-user operating systems
     --------------------------------------------
a) All user-specific parameters are stored in the local registry
   (including the files lastly opened): So no ini-file in the
   Windows directory is needed any more and operating for multi-users
   is supported. 

b) If the user wants to create (or change) files from within CrypTool in
   multi-user systems like Windows XP, then he needs writing access for
   the appropriate target directory (or for the appropriate files). 
   If this does not work, the user normally gets a warning.
   Writing access is explicitly necessary for only two directories:
   - the default Windows directory for temporary files (TEMP) for the
     cry*.* files,
   - the sub-directory "CrypTool\pse", where the created asymmetric keys
     and certificates are stored in.

c) Central installation on a Windows network server:

   Especially in courses at schools educational software is only installed
   at the central machine; the client PCs are calling the program from there.

   This works with the program CrypTool itself. But if the online help is
   called from a client PC, then it will not be displayed according to the
   default settings of Windows XP. This is no prblem specific for CrypTool,
   but for all Windows online help.

   Online help under Windows normally comes from a CHM file, which bundles
   all single HTML help files. Within the Microsoft HTML-Help-Program the
   Internet Explorer is used to display the HTML help files bundled in the
   CHM file.

   Early XP versios allowed a client PC to display help files on a server.
   To close a security gap the Windows XP update (KB896358) was distributed.
   Unfortunately this patch also causes that the Microsoft HTML help
   doesn't display the actual help page [but the meta information like
   content, index or search words are displayed correctly], if you want
   to access from a client help files stored at a server.

   Workaround:
   Because deinstalling a patch is no good idea and because in this scenario
   it is not wanted to store the CHM files locally, you can change or add
   a special registry entry:
   Assuming that the CHM files are stored at a server partition X: with the
   UNC path "\\dir-1\\dir-2" liegen, you can allow the client PC to access
   the server partition by adding the following entry at all client PCs:
   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\HTMLHelp\1.x\ItssRestrictions]
   "UrlAllowList"="\\dir-1\\dir-2;file://\\dir-1\\dir-2;X:\\dir-1\\dir-2;file://X:\\dir-1\\dir-2"

   ATTENTION: Changing the registry can cause Windows to stop working. You are
   solely responsible for such changes.
   To change the client's registry you probably need administrator rights.

While CrypTool is running, the following files are generated and
managed:
cry*.* ........... CrypTool writes temporary files to the \temp
                   directory (file names begin with cry*.*).
       These files have the following file extensions:
                   txt -> text file view
                   hex -> hexadecimal (binary) view
                   plt -> diagram/plot view (histogram, autocorrelation)
                   ogl -> OpenGL graphics view
                   org -> copy of an original file after file open
                   tmp -> temporary file for intermediate results



6.1. Checking the integrity of downloaded files
     ------------------------------------------
The integrity of files can be verified using hash values.
Hash values are like fingerprints -- with a small information base you
are able to identify a much larger object.

There are two ways how files from the CrypTool project can get on your
computer: via direct download or by unpacking a downloaded file:
a) Downloadable files:
   At the homepage of CrypTool www.cryptool.org you can find the
   hash values of all files directly downloadable from the English
   Web page within the files md5sum.txt and sha1sum.txt.
   If you newly calculate the hash of a downloaded file and then
   compare it with the values at the CrypTool homepage, you can see, 
   whether you got an unchanged copy of the original file or not.
   If the hash values are different you should download the file
   again and eventually try to find the reason, why you had a
   modified file at your computer.
b) Additionally you can check the files WITHIN the downloaded setup
   package:
   The hash values of these files are also within the files md5sum.txt
   and sha1sum.txt.

In order to do the integrity check of the downloaded or unpacked files
you can use the wide-spread tools MD5SUM and SHA1SUM.

Alternatively you can use the program CrypTool itself:
  The hash values of "external" files can be calculated, even
  without loading them into CrypTool:
  - click the menu "Indiv. Procedures \ Hash \ Hash Value of a File",
  - open the regarding file,
  - choose MD5 or SHA1 as hash algorithm,
  - compare the shown hash value with the value within md5sum.txt or
    sha1sum.txt.

Security reasons recommend to do the comparison for binary
files (EXE, DLL, PDF, ...), if you are not quite sure, that
your computer is untouched.

10.3. Further freeware projects (Crank, CAP, CryptoStudio, etc)
      ---------------------------------------------------------

Available with complete source code are:

- http://freshmeat.net/projects/crank/
  Crank was initiated in January 2001 by Matthew Russell and is
  released under the GNU general public license, the GPL.
  In the Crank project the idea was to create a program with a graphical
  user interface under Linux which will allow to automatically break
  classical crypto algorithms.
  The focus was on the analysis of mono-alphabetic substitution ciphers
  and the development of generic and flexible analysis tools.
  The current version 0.2.1 was released in August 2001. Since then
  no further development took place.
  On the project web page there are also some interesting links
  on classical cryptanalysis.

- http://freshmeat.net/projects/griffon/
  Griffon was started in 2000 by Adrian Mulvaney and is
  released under the GNU general public license, the GPL.
  Griffon is a GTK+ GUI cryptanalysis package for pre-digital ciphers.
  Mono-alphabetic transposition and substitution ciphers and Playfair
  are covered. The program includes a customizable frequency count.
  The current version 1.0 was released in November 2000. Since then
  no further development took place.

- http://www.kryptosproject.org/          (old)
  http://kryptosproject.sourceforge.net/  (new)
  Kryptos is an open source project begun at the George Mason University.
  Kryptos is educational software for teaching cryptography with a
  static GUI, but many modern algorithms, which can orgin from
  different dynamcally chosable crypto librries.
  It has no cryptanalysis functions.
  The current version Kryptos 3.01 was released in December 2006
  and requires .NET Framework 2.0.

- http://cryptostudio.sourceforge.net/
  CryptoStudio from Prof. Marco Russo
  The current version 1.0 was releases in June 2005 and is available
  in English and Italian.
  It is a GUI (looking like Microsoft's Visual Studio) offering 
  functions of the general purpose cryptographic open source library
  OpenSSL and using its command line tools. So the web page states: 
  "Many of the CryptoStudio functionalities are a mere GUI wrapper of
  OpenSSL tools, intended to make those tools available also to 
  uninitiated users".
  Users can also find utilities for file encryption, basic s/mime mail
  management etc., but no cryptanalysis.


The only other programs known to us, which usefully combine
cryptography and cryptanalysis (under a graphical user interface),
are such, where the source code is not public:

- CAP from Dr. Richard Spillman
  The current version 4.1 was released in 2004 for download.
  This software exists in English only.
  From the programs we know, CAP and CrypTool have the most
  exhaustive functions for cryptanalysis.
  http://www.cs.plu.edu/courses/privacy/index.htm

- CryptAid from David Lovelock
  (development probably stopped already in 1997)
  http://archives.math.utk.edu/software/msdos/miscellaneous/cryptaid/.html

- The Visual Basic program "Cryptological Mathematics" from 
  Prof. R.E. Lewand (vivid presentation of some number theoretic 
  functions, functions for encryption and encryption; no functions
  for cryptanalysis; software to accompany his book; probably from the
  year 2001)
  http://faculty.goucher.edu/blewand/cryptomath/companion_software.htm

- John Trafton's student cryptography project in Java:
  (single statistical functions and classical encryption methods;
  available since December 2002)
  http://phoenix.goucher.edu/~jtrafton/Crypto.

- Wilhelm M. Plotz' Java application "CipherClerk"
  (encryption and decryption with many classic algorithms;
  last update in 2003)
  http://members.aon.at/cipherclerk/

- CryptoBench - GUI around Wei Dai's Crypto++ library
  Compact and clearly arranged GUI implemented around Wei Dai's 
  Crypto++ library (no cryptanalysis).
  The current version 1.0.1 of the CryptoBench exists since 2004.
  Wei Dai's Crypto++ library is open source, the GUI of CryptoBench is 
  freeware, but not open source.
  http://www.addario.org/cryptobench/


If we are missing something here or are incorrect anyhow, please feel
free to inform us, so that we can complete or correct the list.

We explicitly want to state, that we would welcome very much if the
efforts made for these single programs could be combined into one
merged new program. We are very keen about any co-operation!!


10.4. Awards
      ------
In general the biggest award for us is, if CrypTool is broadly used in
education and training. Additinally we have been very glad about the many
positive feedback we got so far.

CrypTool was honored with the following awards (see web page):

- TeleTrusT Special Award
  The TeleTrusT Special Award for education about cryptography and 
  promoting acceptance, awareness and understanding of cryptographic 
  methods was conferred at the ISSE conference.

- European Information Security Award 2004
  The CrypTool project was a finalist in the European Information
  Security Award (EISA 2004) in the category education and training,
  hosted by the RSA conference Europe.

- IT Security Award NRW 2004
  CrypTool and the Institute of Information Systems (University of
  Siegen) received the IT Security Award NRW in the category education
  (eLearning / knowledge transfer about cryptology).

11.1.2. ... Wine configuration
11.1.3. ... Running CrypTool


11.1. Hints for using CrypTool on Linux with Wine
      -------------------------------------------
These hints are based on tests with Wine 0.9.9.

We do not recommend to use CrypTool under Wine, because too many things
there only work partly. A full featured CrypTool version for Linux can
be expected if the port using GCC and Qt4 is successful (see chapter
3.6). Any developers who can contribute to this sub project are most 
welcome.

11.1.1. Installing CrypTool
        -------------------
In the last step of the installation wizard the user has the
option to start CrypTool. This does not work under Wine. Please
start CrypTool as described below.


11.1.2. Wine configuration
        ------------------
CrypTool does not work with the version of riched32.dll built into
Wine. Try to open a file. It will show up empty if the wrong
version of riched32.dll is used. The problem will probably not
occur if Wine is configured to use an existing Windows partition.
If you use Wine without Windows perform the following steps to fix
the problem:
 - Install CrypTool.
 - Get hold of riched32.dll (we are using version 5.0.1458.47)
   and copy it in the CrypTool installation directory.
   Possibly you have to perform the same procedure with other DLLs
   used by riched32.dll.
   Their names are listed in Wine's error output.
 - Configure Wine to use it.
   In the standard configuration this works.
   If it does not add the following line in the [DllOverrides]
   section of the Wine configuration file:
   "riched32" = "native,builtin"


11.1.3. Running CrypTool
        ----------------

11.1.3.1. Starting
          --------
To start CrypTool change to the directory where it was installed
and start it with:

$ wine CrypTool

If you do not change to the installation directory CrypTool will
not find some important files.


11.1.3.2. Bugs and workarounds
          --------------------
* The online help cannot be invoked with F1.
  Use the following line to display the online help:

  $ wine winhlp32 CrypTool.hlp

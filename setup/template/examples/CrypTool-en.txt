What is CrypTool?

CrypTool v1 is a freeware program which enables you to apply and analyze 
cryptographic mechanisms.

CrypTool contains an exhaustive online help, which can be understood 
without deep knowledge in cryptography, therefore no user manual on how 
to use CrypTool is provided. CrypTool is completely available in English 
and German. CrypTool has implemented almost all state-of-the-art crypto 
functions and allows you to learn about and use, modern and classic 
cryptography.

The methods available include both classic methods (e.g. the Caesar 
encryption algorithm) and modern cryptosystems (for example, the RSA 
and AES algorithms, as well as algorithms based on elliptic curves). 
A summary of all the encryption algorithms available in CrypTool v1
is contained on the help page for the "Crypt" menu.

Automatic analysis tools for obtaining the key, starting from a 
knowledge of the encrypted document and any additional information 
(the unencrypted document or the language of the document), are provided 
for the classic encryption algorithms. For additional information on 
automatic analysis, go to the online help for the "Analysis" menu and 
choose the encryption algorithm to be analyzed there.

To support your own analysis of documents, CrypTool can display a 
histogram of the document, and calculate the statistics for N-grams, 
the entropy, and the autocorrelation.

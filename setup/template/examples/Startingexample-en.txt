CrypTool 1 (CT1) is a comprehensive and free educational program
about cryptography and cryptanalysis
offering extensive online help and many visualizations.

This text file was created in order to help you to make your first steps with CT1.

3) There are several examples (tutorials) within the online help which provide an easy way to gain an understanding of cryptology. These examples can be found via the menu "Help -> Scenarios (Tutorials)".

4) You can further develop your knowledge by: 
- Navigating playfully through the menus. You can press F1 at any selected menu item to get more information.
- Reading the included readme file (see the menu "Help -> Readme").

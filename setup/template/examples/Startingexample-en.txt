Starting example for the CrypTool version family 1.x (CT1)

Remark:
The successor versions of CT1 (called CT2, JCT and CTO) now offer a significantly wider range of functionality than CT1. In CT1 only errors will be corrected. Please use the newer versions of CrypTool little by little.

CrypTool 1 (CT1) is a comprehensive and free educational program
about cryptography and cryptanalysis
offering extensive online help and many visualizations.

This text file was created in order to help you to make your first steps with CT1.

1) The starting page of the online help offers the best oversight of CT1's capacity. From the starting page you can reach all essential functions via links.
The starting page of the online help can be accessed via the menu "Help -> Starting Page" at the top right of the main window or by using the search keyword "Starting page" within the index of the online help.
Press F1 to start the online help everywhere in CT1.

2) A possible next step would be to encrypt a file with the Caesar algorithm. This can be done via the menu "Crypt/Decrypt -> Symmetric (classic)".

3) There are several examples (tutorials) within the online help which provide an easy way to gain an understanding of cryptology. These examples can be found via the menu "Help -> Scenarios (Tutorials)".

4) You can further develop your knowledge by: 
- Navigating playfully through the menus. You can press F1 at any selected menu item to get more information.
- Reading the included readme file (see the menu "Help -> Readme").
- Viewing the included colorful presentation. This presentation can be found on several ways: e.g. in the "Help" menu of this application, or via the "Documentation" section found at the "Starting" page of the online help.
- Viewing the webpage www.cryptool.org.

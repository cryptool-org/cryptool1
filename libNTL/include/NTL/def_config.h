                          NTL Configuration File
                          ----------------------

This file may be modified prior to building NTL so as to specify
some basic configuration options, and to customize
how code is generated so as to improve performance.

The Basic Configuration Options must be set by hand.  If you use the
configuration wizard, then these flags should be set before
the installation process begins;  there values will be retained
by the wizard.

The Performance Options can be set either by hand, by editing this 
file, or (on most Unix platforms) can be set automatically using
the configuration wizard which runs when NTL is installed.

All NTL include (".h") files include this file.
By setting these flags here, instead of on the compiler command line,
it is easier to guarantee that NTL library and client code use
consistent settings.  


                                How to do it
                                ------------

You override NTL's default code generation strategies by setting
various flags, as described below.  To set a flag, just replace the
pre-processor directive 'if 0' by 'if 1' for that flag, 
which causes the appropriate macro to be defined.  Of course, 
to unset a flag, just replace the 'if 1' by an 'if 0'.

<h3><P><A NAME="Number Shark"></A><B>Real factors</B></P></h3>

<P>All factors of a number, beside the number itself are called true factors<br>
All factors of the number "20" for example are "1", "2", "4", "5", "10" and "20".<br>
But the true factors of the number "20" are only the "1", "2", "4", "5" and "10".</p>
<p>In the Number Shark game the Number Shark always gets all free real factors of the selected number.<br>
Usually you get the selected number added to your points, but only when real factors of this number are left in the game. When you choose a number without any more true factors left, than the Number Shark gets this number.</p>

<h3><P><A NAME="tutorial"></A><B>Number Shark tutorial on an example with 20 numbers</B></P></h3>

<p>Number Shark is an educational game for children (and andults ;)) to improve their knowledge of factors 
and <a href="NumberSharkPrimes.html">prime numbers</a>.</p>

<p>At the beginning the shell square will be filled with a certain amount of numbers (for example the 
numbers 1-20).</p>

<p>This game is easy with a small amount of numbers, but a real challenge with a high amount of numbers.</p>

<p><h4><u>1. The game idea</u></h4></p>

<p>The game idea is to win as many of the numbers as possible for yourself, so that the sum of your numbers 
is higher than the sum of the Number Shark, and also to score as high as possible. When you choose a number, 
the Number Shark gets all free <a href="NumberSharkRealFactors.html">real factors</a> until there are no more 
numbers left in the game.</p>

<p>In this tutorial part of the online help the game course will be described on an example game with 20 
numbers.</p>

<p><h4><u>2. Options at the beginning of a new game</u></h4></p>

<p>When you start the game the first time you see the <b>Welcome</b> tab in the front.</p>

<P><IMG SRC="Pictures_en/Dlg_options1_en.png" ALT="Dlg_options1_en.png" BORDER=0></p>

<P>In the game options window you can</P>

<ul>
	<li>enter your name,</li>
	<li>switch the tool tips for the shell square on or off,</li>
	<li>decide if you want to see this dialog <u>before</u> the next program start and</li>
	<li>you can decide if the program should remember the last amount of numbers with which you played for 
	the next program start.</li>
</ul>

<P>You can start the game without setting any options by pressing the enter key or the <b>To the game</b> 
button.</P>

<p><h4><u>3. The first round</u></h4></p>

<P><IMG SRC="Pictures_en/Dlg_main_en.png" ALT="Dlg_main_en.png" BORDER=0 width="91%"></p>

<p>When you first start the game, there is an amount of 20 numbers set for the shell square. We kept this 
for the tutorial.</p>

<p>Because the Number Shark gets every available <a href="NumberSharkRealFactors.html">real factor</a> of the 
chosen number (and even the number itself if there are no more factors left), you should try to give the 
Number Shark in most cases only one number in every round.<br>To achieve an optimal score, you must always 
start the game with the highest prime number available, because prime numbers only have "1" and itself as a 
factor. The highest prime number in the number stack in our example is the "19".<br>The Number Shark always 
gets the "1" after the first round, because the "1" is a factor of every number.<br>Every chosen number or 
shell (from you or from the Number Shark) is colored in gray and can't be used any longer in the game.</p>

<P><IMG SRC="Pictures_en/Dlg_game_19_en.png" ALT="Dlg_game_19_en.png" BORDER=0 width="91%"></p>

<p>The button <b>Shark food</b> gets active if there are numbers in the game which can't give you any more 
points (this happens if there are numbers available with no more factors and which at the same time are not 
a factor of another available number). With this button you can pass all these numbers directly to the Number 
Shark. You should use this button always when it appears in order to have a better overview.</p>

<p><h4><u>4.Next rounds</u></h4></p>
<p>It's getting more difficult after the first round. Normally, the Number Shark should only get one factor 
in every round, but sometimes this is not possible. The "2" for example is a factor of many numbers. That's 
why you should try to give the Number Shark as few factors as possible, but you shouldn't choose numbers that 
are too small, because they could be one of only a few factors of another number. So in the next round you 
should choose the "10" (=2*5) or "14" (=2*7). In our example we take the number "10".</p>

<P><IMG SRC="Pictures_en/Dlg_game_10_en.png" ALT="Dlg_game_10_en.png" BORDER=0 width="91%"></p>

<p>After the "10" we can now choose the "14" as the next number, because it has left only the "7" as a 
factor.</p>

<P><IMG SRC="Pictures_en/Dlg_game_14_en.png" ALT="Dlg_game_14_en.png" BORDER=0 width="91%"></p>

<p>In the next two rounds you should choose "15" and "20" because both only have one factor (3 or 4) 
left.</p>

<p><IMG SRC="Pictures_en/Dlg_game_15_en.png" ALT="Dlg_game_15_en.png" BORDER=0 width="91%"></p>

<p>Now are only three numbers with free factors are left: the "12", "16" and "18".</p>

<p><IMG SRC="Pictures_en/Dlg_game_20_en.png" ALT="Dlg_game_20_en.png" BORDER=0 width="91%"></p>


<P>Of the three at least there is a clear sequence order between "12" and "18".</P>

<p>It is suggested to take the "12" before the "18". Both have the "6" as a factor, but the "18" also has 
the number "9". If you first take "18" than you can't take the "12" later in the game and you wasted 
points.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter if you take "16" or the "12" at first.</p>

<p><IMG SRC="Pictures_en/Dlg_game_16_en.png" ALT="Dlg_game_16_en.png" BORDER=0 width="91%"></p>

<p>The last number with free factors is the "18".</p>

<p><IMG SRC="Pictures_en/Dlg_game_18_en.png" ALT="Dlg_game_18_en.png" BORDER=0 width="91%"></p>

<p><a name="Remaining">If</a> you had pressed the <b>Shark food</b> button after the first round, then 
the game is over now. If you didn't, you can do it now or you have to click the last three numbers 
individually to finish the game. But you won't get anymore points for these numbers.</p>

<p><IMG SRC="Pictures_en/Dlg_game_food_en.png" ALT="Dlg_game_food_en.png" BORDER=0 width="91%"></p>

<p>Now the game is over.</p>

<p><IMG SRC="Pictures_en/Dlg_win_max_en.png" ALT="Dlg_win_max_en.png" BORDER=0></p>

<p>At the end of the game, the program produces a summary of the game. This file can be saved in the same 
folder where the game is. The file is called: [number stack]_[player points]_[your name]_summary.txt. If 
you play a new game with the same values, then this file will be overwritten.</p>

<p><a name="Summary">The</a> summary contains:
<ul>
	<li>the date and time when this file was created,</li>
	<li>your name, if you entered it in the game options,</li>
	<li>the chosen number stack,</li>
	<li>the complete game course,</li>
	<li>the achieved score of points from the player and the Number Shark,</li>
	<li>the number of rounds you played,</li>
	<li>the maximum possible points, if this value is known.</li></p>
</ul>
<p><IMG SRC="Pictures_en/Dlg_summary_en.png" ALT="Dlg_summary_en.png" BORDER=0 width="91%"></p>

<p>You can start a new game in the main window anytime you wish.<br>
If you start a new game the course table will be cleared and all shells switch to active again. 
The number for the number stack won't change, this is only possible by entering a new number and 
clicking the <b>OK</b> button (or pressing Enter).</p>

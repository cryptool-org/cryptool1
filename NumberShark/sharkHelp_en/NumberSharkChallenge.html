<P>For numbers up to 158, <b>optimal</b> results have been calculated already
(thanks to Dan Hoey), and stored in this program (including one way to achieve
the respective optimal score).</P>

</P>For numbers up to 404, we have calculated <b>good</b> results with heuristic methods (thanks 
to Markus Schu and Volker van Nek), and stored in the program.
Unfortunately, we don't know (yet) if these results higher than n=158 are optimal.</P>

<P>You can help us to enhance the data we have gathered so far.
We'd be pleased if you ...</P>

<UL>

<LI><b>find an optimal result for numbers up to 158</b>. You have achieved the
same score that we have, but maybe you found another way to get there.</LI><br>

<LI><b>win a game for numbers larger than 158 and smaller than 405</b>.
If your result is better than the already calculated result we'd be very happy if
you could send us the log file of your game course.</LI><br>

<LI><b>win a game for numbers larger than 404</b>.
Please send us the log file of your best game course.</LI><br>

<LI><b>have an idea for a new algorithm</b> to calculate the highest score
(optimal result) possible. For that, two algorithms are implemented in CT1: The first one
subsequently tries out every possible solution (brute force).
The second one deals with partial solutions to determine the result
(back tracking).
We'd highly appreciate any new approaches in this regard.</LI> 

</UL>

<P>If you have mastered any of these challenges, feel free to send your results and comments to 
<b>esslinger@fb5.uni-siegen.de</b>.</P>

<P><b>Remark</b></P>
Heuristic algorithms for the number shark problem are implemented within JCrypTool (the platform-independent successor of CT1).
Heuristic algorithms fast find a good solution which typically is a bit worse than the optimal value.

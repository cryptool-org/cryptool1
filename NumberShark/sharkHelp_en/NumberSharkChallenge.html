<P>Optimal results for numbers up to 158 have been calculated already
(thanks to Dan Hoey), and stored in the program (including one way to achieve
the respective optimal score).
For numbers up to 404 we have calculated results with heuristic methods (thanks 
to Mr. Schu and Mr. van Nek) -- but we don't know if these results are optimal.</P>

<P>You can help us to upgrade the data we have gathered so far.
We'd be pleased if you...</P>

<UL>

<LI><b>find an optimal result for numbers up to 158</b>. You have achieved the
same score that we have, but maybe you found another way to get there.</LI>

<LI><b>win a game for numbers larger than 158</b>. We have already calculated
results for numbers up to 404, but we don't know whether these results are
optimal.</LI>

<LI><b>have an idea for a new algorithm</b> to calculate the highest score
possible. Until now we have implemented two algorithms: The first one subsequently
tries out every possible solution (brute-force).
The second one deals with partial solutions to determine the result
(back-tracking).
We'd highly appreciate any new approaches in this regard.</LI>

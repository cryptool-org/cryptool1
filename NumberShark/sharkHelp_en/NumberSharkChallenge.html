<h3><P><A NAME="zahlenhai"></A><B>Challenge</B></P></h3>

<P>We have already calculated optimal results for numbers up to 158 and stored them in the program (including one way 
to achieve the respective score). For numbers up to 170 we have calculated results with a heuristic method - but we don't 
know if these results are optimal.</P>

<P>You can help us to upgrade the data we have gathered so far. We'd be pleased if you...</P>

<UL>

<LI><b>find an optimal result for numbers up to 158</b>. You have achieved the same score that we have, but maybe you found a 
new way to get there.</LI>

<LI><b>win a game for numbers larger than 158</b>. We have already calculated results for numbers up to 170, but we can't tell 
if these results are optimal.</LI>

<LI><b>have an idea for a new algorithm</b> to calculate the highest score possible. Until now we have implemented two 
algorithms: The first one subsequently trys out every possible solution (brute-force). The second one deals with partial 
solutions to determine the result (back-tracking). We'd highly appreciate any new approaches in this regard.</LI>

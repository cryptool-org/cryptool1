<P>1) For total numbers &gt; 22 we need your help!</P>
<p>We have saved the maximum possible points and one of the best ways to get these points for numbers &lt; 22 in our program. For numbers all &lt; 50 we have scores by practicing the game, but we don’t know if these are the highest possible scores. If you win a game with more numbers than 50, we would be pleased if you could send us your results to esslinger@fb5.uni-siegen.de. Please send the whole summary so that we can trace the way you have chosen to play the game.</p>
 
<p>2)<b> A true challenge</b><br>The algorithm we used to calculate the maximum possible score and to find an optimal way tries all possibilities to play a game (Brute-force). If somebody is not only doing brute-force and has a better algorithm to calculate the values we would be very interested in this algorithm and would like to use it in our program. And of course we would mention you if you wish.</p>

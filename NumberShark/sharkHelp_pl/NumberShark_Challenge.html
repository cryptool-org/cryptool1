<h3><P><A NAME="zahlenhai"></A><B>Challenge</B></P></h3>

<P>1) <b>For total numbers &gt; 22 we need your help!</b></P>
<p>We already saved the results for numbers &lt; 22 and one way to achieve this score in the program. For all numbers &lt; 50 we have scores by playing the game, but we don’t know if these are the highest possible scores.<br>
If you win a game with more numbers than 22, or you calculated a result, and one way to achieve this result, on your pc with the help of brute-force, we would be pleased if you could send us your results to<br>
<b>esslinger@fb5.uni-siegen.de</b>.<br>Please send the whole summary so that we can trace the way you have chosen to play the game.</p>
<br> 
<p>2)<b> A true challenge</b></p>
<p>The algorithm we used to calculate the maximum possible score and to find an optimal way tries all possibilities to play a game (brute-force). If somebody is not only doing brute-force and has a better algorithm to calculate the values we would be very interested in this algorithm and would like to use it in our program. And of course we would mention you if you wish.</p>
<p>Please send your idea or implementation to <b>esslinger@fb5.uni-siegen.de</b>.</p>

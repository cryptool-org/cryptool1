<h3>Dialog Secret Sharing Demonstration: Initializing the threshold scheme</h3>

<P>This dialogue can be achieved via the menu Individual Procedures \ <A 
href="hid_einzelverfahren_secretsharingdemo.html">Secret-Sharing-Demo</A>.</P>
<P>This dialogue demonstrates the (t, n) threshold scheme invented by Adi <FONT 
style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #316ac5" color=#ffffff>Shamir</FONT>. It offers 
possibilities to freely choose the necessary parameters and to select those 
participants who want to cooperate in reconstructing the secret.</P>
<P><IMG alt=SS_Setup.gif src="images/SS_Setup.gif" border=0></P>
<P>First of all, you have to enter your secret K as a decimal within the group 
box labeled "Choose your secret". You can call a dialogue to change the limit to 
the number of participants by clicking the button "Options" as well.</P>
<P>Right in the middle of the dialogue all parameters that are neccessarily 
needed to setup a <A href="shamir.html"><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #316ac5" 
color=#ffffff>Shamir</FONT> scheme</A> can be entered. In detail, you have to 
fix the number of participants n that take part in your scheme and your 
threshold t. By clicking the button "Generate polynomial", CrypTool (as the 
dealer of the scheme) generates at random a prime p that determines the field in 
which all calculations take place. In addition, a polynomial of degree t-1 and 
with randomly chosen coefficients is constructed.</P>
<P>If you now accept these parameters, the list control displays all 
participants. CrypTool has randomly chosen a public value x from GF(p) for each 
of the participants. Furthermore, the polynomial has been evaluated for all 
these values. Consequently, you are presented a list of all participants and 
their shares.</P>
<P>A group of participants can be selected by pressing the Ctrl key and using 
your mouse to mark the desired items.</P>
<P><IMG alt=SS_SetupDone.gif src="images/SS_SetupDone.gif" border=0></P>
<P>If you wish to reconstruct your secret, you have to left-click the button 
"Reconstruction". A new <A href="hidd_secretsharing_reveal.html">dialogue</A> 
then opens to display the reconstructed secret.</P>

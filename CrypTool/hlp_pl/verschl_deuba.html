<UL>
<LI>protection of the confidentiality of documents,</LI>

<LI>proof of the origin of messages,</LI>

<LI>user authentication (authenticity),</LI>

<LI>assurance of the binding nature of transactions (non-repudiation),</LI>

<LI>assurance of the integrity of data.</LI>
</UL>

<P>These security mechanisms are used in many different applications, for which they have to be implemented on many different system platforms, from smart cards through to mainframe computers.</P>

<LI>to protect e-mails and file transfers</LI>

<LI>for remote access</LI>

<LI>to encrypt hard disks on PCs</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>To protect customer applications</B>:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Internet banking and Internet broking</LI>

<LI>home banking (HBCI)</LI>

<LI>electronic banking (BCS)</LI>

<LI>smart card applications (money card (GeldKarte), ec card with chip)</LI>

<LI>e-commerce (SET transactions)</LI>
</UL>

<h3>Dialog Password Quality Meter</h3>

<P>You can access this dialog using the menu entry <a href="menu_related_methods.html">Individual Procedures</a> \ <a href="menu_relatedmethods_tools.html">Tools</a> \ <a href="hid_passwordqualitymeter.html">Password Quality Meter</a>.</P>

<P>It is impossible to exactly determine the security of a password, because too many factors play a role. This dialog contains different password quality meters helping you to estimate the security of your passwords.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/passwordqualitymeter.gif" ALT="passwordqualitymeter.gif"></P>

<h4><u>Usage of the dialog</u></h4>

<P>Please enter your password in the given input field to determine the <a href="#passwordquality">password quality</a>. The password quality is automatically updated with each key stroke.</P>

<P>The quality estimation of your password is based on four different algorithms. Three of those algorithms come from the applications KeePass, Mozilla and PGP, which all have a password quality meter integrated. The fourth approach is an experimental approach of the CrypTool team.</P>

<P>Besides the percental display in the lower part of the dialog there is a coloured smiley. It displays the password quality in five categories ranging from poor (<B>red</B>) over weak (<B>orange</B>), average (<B>yellow</B>) and good (<B>green</B>) to great (<B>light green</B>). Please note that the graphical display only refers to the result of the experimental approach.</P>

<P>Below the password input field you can select whether you want to enter the password in the clear or have it hidden with place holders (*).</P>

<h4><u><a name="passwordquality"></a>Password quality</u></h4>

<P>The term <B>password quality</B> is <B>a measure for the security of your password</B>.</P>

<P>In the context of most programs offering password quality measurement, the password quality is based on the <a href="#passwordentropy">password entropy</a>. This approach is used by KeePass and PGP for example.</P>

<P>Besides, there are different approaches like the one integrated in the Mozilla browser. Here the letters of the alphabet are grouped and evaluated apart (i.e. special characters and lowercase letters). </P>

<P>Normally, password quality is shown in percent. The scaling depends on the measurement approach: For entropy-based password quality measurement a password entropy of 128 bit is assumed to equal a password quality of 100%. But there are different approaches for quality scaling depending on the quality measurement approach used.</P>

<P>The two following examples will show how the different approaches to password quality measurement affect the result:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The password <B>a-a-a</B> results in a much higher quality with Mozilla than with PGP (60% and 16%). The result of PGP sounds plausible because the password is very short. The result of Mozilla seems too high. The reason for this is the following: With five characters the password possesses the required minimum length without getting a penalty for shortness. With the two additional special characters the password quality increases further to the aforementioned 60%.</LI>
<LI>The password <B>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</B> results in a much lower quality rating with Mozilla than with PGP (30% and 100%). The result of Mozilla sounds plausible. Although the password is very long it can be guessed quite easily. PGP, on the other hand, seems to consider only the length of the password.</LI>
</UL>

<h4><u>Password length, password space and password entropy</u></h4>

<P>If you factor out inappropriate handling and storage of passwords, then the security of a password depends on the length of the password, the size of the password space and the entropy of the password.</P>

<P>The <B>length</B> of a password has a huge influence on its security. Short passwords can easily be guessed, so in turn a short password is a bad password. The longer a password, the better.</P>

<P>The <B>size</B> of the password space is the amount of passwords that can be created with all available characters (the alphabet). Assume you have an alphabet of 52 letters (upper- and lowercase) as well as ten digits, then the password space consists of 62^8, that is around 200 trillion passwords. If you increase the size of the alphabet with 10 more characters (for example special characters), the password space grows to more than three times of its size. The bigger the password space, the better.</P>

<P><a name="passwordentropy"></a>The password <B>entropy</B> indicates how "randomly" a password is chosen out of the given password space. Based on certain statistical assumptions you can exactly determine the <a href="entropie.html">entropy</a> of a password.</P>

<P><B>Remark</B>:</P>

<P>A high password quality doesn't necessarily mean that you picked a good password! For example there is no dictionary checking implemented yet (words out of dictionaries are considered to be bad passwords in general). The CrypTool team plans to consider this with its experimental approach in the next release.</P>

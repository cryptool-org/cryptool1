<h3>ASN.1 – Abstract Syntax Notation number One</h3>

<P><I>Abstract Syntax Notation number One</I> is a standard that allows encoding of arbitrary data. ASN.1 was first standardized by the ITU (<I>International Telecommunications Union</I>) in 1984.</P>

<P>ASN.1 is mainly used in telecommunication protocols. Therefore it is widely spread on almost every computer platform and supported by most programming languages.</P>

<P>There is a huge variety of different areas of application for ASN.1. Nevertheless, certificates seem to be most interesting from a cryptographical point of view since most certificates are encoded in ASN.1 format.</P>

<P>ASN.1 is able to encode the following data types: Integers, Booleans, character strings and even time-referenced types. Additionally ASN.1 enables the user to assemble custom data types (complex structures and lists, for instance) based on the simple types already mentioned.</P>

<P>Data transmitted by ASN.1 is stored in hierarchical structures. Therefore ASN.1 offers another data type called <B><I>object identifier</I></B>. Strictly speaking the object identifier simply is a list of integers. Still, the object identifier is capable of identifying each object in ASN.1 uniquely.</P>

<P>The actual data transmission in binary format between two applications for instance is defined by the so called <B><I>encoding rules</I></B>. There exist different kinds of encoding rules and they are also standardized.</P>

<P>Please visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Notation_One" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Notation_One</a> for further information on Abstract Syntax Notation number One.</P>

<P>CrypTool allows you to <a href="hid_einzelverfahren_asn1decodieren.html">decode an ASN.1 encoded file</a>.</P>

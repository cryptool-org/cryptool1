		<h3>Dialog Diffie-Hellman Visualization</h3>
		<P>You can reach this dialog via the menu entry <a href="menu_related_methods.html">Individual 
				Procedures</a> \ <a href="menu_individualprocedures_protocols.html">Protocols</a>
			\ <a href="hid_einzelverfahren_diffiehellmandemo.html">Diffie-Hellman Demonstration</a>.</P>
		<P>This dialog is supposed to help you understand the <A href="dh-verfahren.html">Diffie-Hellman 
				key exchange protocol</A>.</P>
		<P><IMG SRC="images/dh_maindialogue.gif" ALT="dh_maindialogue.gif" BORDER="0"></P>
		<P>Please be sure to mark the check box <B>Show information dialogs</B> if you are 
			new to the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. By doing this you receive 
			useful information concerning the operating sequence throughout the whole 
			proceeding:<br>An information dialog will pop up each time a button is pushed. If the checkbox is not marked, you will 
			be solely responsible for executing the key exchange in the correct order. Within each information dialog <b>F1</b> offers
			additional online help, and you can mark the check box <b>Show introduction dialog</b> to 
			see a short introduction the next time this dialog is started.</P>
		<P>In the visualization dialog there are <B>inactive buttons</B> as well as <B>active buttons</B>
			to ease the handling of the dialog. Take into account that only the active 
			buttons can be pushed. Which buttons are active depends on the particular step you are in. While inactive buttons have got a gray hue and seem to 
			be a bit faded, active buttons look bright and painted.</P>
		<P>Furthermore there are <B>green buttons</B> and <B>red buttons</B> to distinguish 
			the different partial stages of the key exchange protocol. A red button 
			indicates that a certain function has not been executed yet, while a green 
			button is indicating the completion of the respective function.</P>
		<P>On the left side of the dialog you can find a <B>navigation bar</B>. Please use 
			the navigation buttons to initiate each of the specific stages as follows:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			Setting the public parameters
			<LI>
			Choosing the secrets
			<LI>
			Creating the shared keys
			<LI>
			Exchanging the shared keys
			<LI>
				Creating the common and secret key (<I>session key</I>)</LI>
		</UL>
		<P>Although the <A href="hidd_diffiehellman_publicparameters.html">setting of the 
				public parameters</A> is deemed to both Alice and Bob, all further steps 
			need to be accomplished separately. The separation between Alice and Bob is 
			indicated by two <B>group boxes</B>. They symbolize private areas for Alice and 
			Bob respectively. Nobody else but the authorized party gains an insight into 
			these private areas.</P>
		<P>On the other hand the public parameters are an exception because they are freely 
			accessible for everyone and therefore not safe. This is indicated by the group 
				box "Public parameters" overlapping the public area as well as the 
			private areas of Alice and Bob. The transferred data A and B are also 
			considered as public.</P>
		<P>According to this not only Alice and Bob are able to gain knowledge of the 
			public parameters: every third party can view the public parameters, too. After 
			having set the public parameters you need to continue with choosing the secret 
			numbers of Alice and Bob.</P>
		<P>Alice's and Bob's secret numbers need to be chosen separately because Alice may 
			not gain knowledge of Bob‚s secret and the other way around.</P>
		<P>First of all you need to push the button <B>Choose secrets</B>. Thereby the two <B>Secret</B>
			buttons of Alice and Bob are activated. If you push one of those buttons, the 
			following <A href="hidd_diffiehellman_secretinput.html">dialog</A> appears to 
			prompt you for Alice's or Bob's secret number.</P>
		<P>Now you must create the shared keys of Alice and Bob, which are a necessity to 
			compute the common and secret session key at the end of the key exchange; 
			please click the button <B>Create shared keys</B> first to activate the <B>Calculate</B>
			buttons of Alice and Bob. Analogically to the last step you need to calculate 
			the shared keys separately.</P>
		<P>After the calculation the shared keys need to be exchanged, that means Alice 
			sends her shared key over to Bob and Bob sends his shared key over to Alice. To 
			do this please push the button <B>Exchange shared keys</B> on the navigation 
			bar.</P>
		<P>Now every party can compute the secret and common session key on its own. Push 
			the button <B>Generate common Session Key</B> to let Alice and Bob compute 
			their session keys.</P>
		<P>If you need further information on the session key, just push the key icon at 
			the lower side of the dialog.</P>
		<P><B>Remark 1</B>:</P>
		<P>The Diffie-Hellman key exchange can <B>not be used for encryption</B>. It is 
			"solely" for key agreement.</P>
		<P><B>Remark 2</B>:</P>
		<P>The Diffie-Hellman protocol is vulnerable against <a href="man_in_the_middle.html">man-in-the-middle attacks</a>:</P>
		<P>If the attacker is able to pose as Bob against Alice and to pose as Alice 
			against Bob (the attacker stands in the middle of the communication), then he 
			obtains a common secret key with Alice and a different common secret key with 
			Bob.</P>
		<P>This attack can be prevented by using <a href="certificates.html">digital certificates</a> to identify Alice 
			against Bob and vice versa.</P>
		<P><B>Remark 3</B>:</P>
		<P>In chapter 4.12.2 of the CrypTool <A class="filelink" onclick="parser('script-en.pdf')">
				script</A> you can find additional information on the mathematical 
			background of the protocol.</P>

<h3><P><A NAME="hidd_diffiehellmanvisualization"></A><B>Dialogue Diffie-Hellman Visualization</B></P></h3>

<P>This dialogue is supposed to help you understand the <A href="dh-verfahren.html">Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol</A>.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/dh_maindialogue.gif" ALT="dh_maindialogue.gif" BORDER=0></P>

<P>Please be sure to mark the <B>Show information dialogues</B> check box if you are new to the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. By doing this you receive useful information concerning the operating sequence throughout the whole proceeding.</P>

<P>An information dialogue will pop up each time a button is pushed if the <B>Show information dialogues</B> checkbox is marked. If it is not marked, you will be solely responsible for executing the key exchange in the correct order.</P>

<P>In this dialogue there are <B>inactive buttons</B> as well as <B>active buttons</B> to ease the handling of the dialogue. Take into account that only the active buttons can be pushed. While inactive buttons have got a grey hue and seem to be a bit faded, active buttons look bright and painted.</P>

<P>Furthermore there are <B>green buttons</B> and <B>red buttons</B> to distinguish the different partial stages of the key exchange protocol. A red button indicates that a certain function has not been executed yet, while a green button is indicating the completion of the respective function.</P>

<P>On the left side of the dialogue you can find a <B>navigation bar</B>. Please use the navigation buttons to initiate each of the specific stages as follows:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Setting the public parameters</LI>

	<LI>Choosing the secrets</LI>

	<LI>Creating the shared keys</LI>

	<LI>Exchanging the shared keys</LI>

	<LI>Creating the common and secret key (<I>session key</I>)</LI>
</UL>

<P>Although the <A href="hidd_diffiehellman_publicparameters.html">setting of the public parameters</A> is deemed to both Alice and Bob, all further steps need to be accomplished separately. The separation between Alice and Bob is indicated by two <B>group boxes</B>. They symbolize private areas for Alice and Bob respectively. Nobody else but the authorized party gains an insight into these private areas.</P>

<P>On the other hand the public parameters are an exception because they are freely accessible for everyone and therefore not safe. This is indicated by the <B>group box "Public parameters"</B> overlapping the public area as well as the private areas of Alice and Bob. The transferred data A and B are also considered as public.</P>

<P>According to this not only Alice and Bob are able to gain knowledge of the public parameters: every third party can view the public parameters, too. After having set the public parameters you need to continue with choosing the secret numbers of Alice and Bob.</P>

<P>Alice‚s and Bob‚s secret numbers need to be chosen separately because Alice may not gain knowledge of Bob‚s secret and the other way around.</P>

<P>First of all you need to push the button <B>Choose secrets</B>. Thereby the two <B>Secret</B> buttons of Alice and Bob are activated. If you push one of those buttons, the following <A href="hidd_diffiehellman_secretinput.html">dialogue</A> appears to prompt you for Alice or Bob‚s secret number.</P>

<P>Now you must create the shared keys of Alice and Bob, which are a necessity to compute the common and secret session key at the end of the key exchange; please click the button <B>Create shared keys</B> first to activate the <B>Calculate</B> buttons of Alice and Bob. Analogically to the last step you need to calculate the shared keys separately.</P>

<P>After the calculation the shared keys need to be exchanged, that means Alice sends her shared key over to Bob and Bob sends his shared key over to Alice. To do this please push the <B>button Exchange shared keys</B> on the navigation bar.</P>

<P>Now every party can compute the secret and common session key on its own. Push the button <B>Generate common Session Key</B> to let Alice and Bob compute their session keys.</P>

<P>If you need further information on the session key, just push the key icon at the lower side of the dialogue.</P>

<P><B>Remark 1</B>:</P>

<P>The Diffie-Hellman key exchange can <B>not be used for encryption</B>. It is solely for key agreement.</P>

<P><B>Remark 2</B>:</P>

<P>The Diffie-Hellman protocol is vulnerable against Man-In-The-Middle attacks:</P>

<P>If the attacker is able to pose as Bob against Alice and to pose as Alice against Bob (the attacker stands in the middle of the communication), then he obtain a common secret key with alice and a different common secret key with Bob.</P>

<P>This attack can be prevented by using digital certificates to identify Alice against Bob and vice versa.</P>

<P><B>Remark 3</B>:</P>

<P>In chapter 3.12.2 of the CrypTool <A class="filelink" onclick="parser('script-en.pdf')">script</A> you can find additional information on the mathematical background of the proceeding.</P>

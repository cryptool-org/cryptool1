<h3>Correlation</h3>

<P>The correlation is a quantitative measure to describes coherences. The correlation analysis considers <B>criterias</B> (e.g. experimental results) and measures - based on a <B>hypothesis</B> - their connection properties. </P>

<P>The quality of the correspondence between criterias and the considered hypothesis is characterised by the <B>correlation coefficient</B>. </P>

<P>The correlation coefficient r is a number of the range -1 and +1. In the case r is near by +1 (r is near by -1) then there is a good connection between the criterias and the hyptothesis (between the criterias and and the "reverse" hypothesis). </P>

<P>If r is near by 0 it is suggested that the criterias are "non correlated" to the hypothesis.</P>

<P>The statistical cryptanalysis is searching for a hypothesis that has a maximum correlation. </P>

<P><B>Example.</B> Correlation analysis to determine a Caesar encryption key:</P>

<P>At the first step of the Caesar analysis the histograms of the ciphertext and of a reference text are determined (you may define the reference file via menu <B>Options \ <A href="hid_opttext.html">Text Options</A></B>). The main hypothesis is that the histograms of the decrypted ciphertext and the reference text are equal.</P>

<P>Based on this hypothesis the following key hypotheses are derived: the Caesar key is the letter "A", the Caesar key is the letter "B", etc. The key hypothesis with the best correlation is the output of the Caesar analysis:</P>

<P>In this example the letter "J" is the result of the Caesar analysis. </P>

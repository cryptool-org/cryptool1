<P>As shown for the hybrid encryption, the symmetric encryption key must be securely transported from the sender to the receiver. Each pair of sender and receiver shares a common secret key. For technical reasons and to evade the huge efforts for mass direct key exchange of the different keys, other methods have been invented, which depend on a public distribution of the session keys. This session key is generated interactively and unknown by others for each session.</P>

<P>Besides the asymmetric encryption methods multiple methods for key exchange exist, which make use of public and private keys too. The most famous and even today implemented method was developed by <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="diffie_hellman.html">Diffie and Hellman</A>.</P>

<P><A NAME="hid_einzelverfahren_schluesselgenerieren"></A><B>Dialogue Key Generation from Password</B></P>

<P>Even if a cryptographic application is secure, at the end of the day in practice user security depends on a secret text, the password. The password itself is generally not directly usable for such cryptosystems, but instead a key is calculated from the password. In the <B>Key Generation</B> dialogue it is possible to generate cryptographically secure keys out of passwords. Implementation is oriented here towards the RSA <A href="standards.html">standard</A> PKCS#5.</P>

<P>The derived key is dependent on other parameters as well as the secret password: the seed, the hash function and the number of iterations used in each case for the <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="hashfunktion.html">hash function</A>.</P>

<P>The additional initialisation value, the "seed", offers the possibility of generating different keys (dependent on the seed initialisation) from one and the same password.</P>

<P>With the aid of hash functions a key is securely calculated from the password and the seed.</P>

<P>In accordance with the PKCS#5 standard on key generation, you can choose one of the following hash functions:</P>

<P><!--ZZZINDN--></P>

<P>MD2128 bits = 16 bytes hash function</P>

<P>MD5128 bits = 16 bytes hash function and</P>

<P>SHA1160 bits = 20 bytes hash function</P>

<P><!--ZZZINDNE--></P>

<P>Depending on which hash function you choose, the maximum output length of the key will be either 16 or 20 bytes.</P>

<P>To make <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="textboock_attack.html">dictionary attacks</A> more difficult, passwords are worked out from repeated use of the hash function. The number of hash iterations increases significantly the amount of effort needed for a successful attack. A minimum of one and a maximum of 10,000 hash iterations can be performed. It is recommended that 1,000 hash iterations are performed.</P>

<P>In the next example an eight-byte key is generated from the (weak) password HUND which, for example, can be used for encryption with <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="hid_crypt_des_desecb.html">DES</A> (to do this, the generated key is simply copied to the clipboard):</P>

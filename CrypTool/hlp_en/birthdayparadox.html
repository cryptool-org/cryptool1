<h3><P><A NAME="birthdayparadox"></A><B>Birthday attack/birthday paradox</B></P></h3>

<P>The birthday-paradox is a phenomenon from the theory of probabilities, where the statistical probabilities of two similar incidents are surprisingly very different.</P>

<P>Usually the following two scenarios are compared to make this evident:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>How many people does a host have to invite to his birthday party, that the probability is at least 50% that at least <B>one guest</B> has his birthday <I>at the same day</I> as <B>the host</B>?
<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>How many people must be at the birthday party that the probability is at least 50% that <B>any two guests</B> have birthday at the same day?</LI>
</OL>

<P>Answer: At least <B>253 people</B> must be there, that the probability is higher than 50%, that the host is not the only birthday celebrant.</P>

<P>On the opposite there are only <B>23 guests</B> necessary, that the probability is higher than 50%, that two of the guests have the same birthday (which date does not matter).</P>

<P>Because of the big difference between 253 guests in the first scenario and 23 guests in the second scenario, this is called a paradox.</P>

<P>Details how to get to these numbers can be found in <I>Methoden und Werkzeuge für Angriffe auf die digitale Signatur</I>, 2003 by Jan Blumenstein.</P>

<P>Transferring this example to the search for hash value collisions means:</P>

<P>If changes are allowed at both documents instead of keeping one document fixed, then one needs to calculate the hash values of a <B>dramatically</B> less number of changed documents to find 2 documents with the same hash value.</P>

<P>If the initial document isn't allowed to be changed and one uses a 128-bit hash function, then you need to calculate <!--ZZZFORMEL--> 2<SUP>127</SUP> hash values of changed documents to achieve a probability of 50% to find another document with the same hash value <!--ZZZFORMEL--> (2<SUP>127 </SUP> ~ 1,7 * 10<SUP>38</SUP>).</P>

<P>The birthday attack allows you to break 128-bit hash functions after <!--ZZZFORMEL--> 2<SUP>64</SUP> calculations: The changes are made at both documents – analogous to the 2<SUP>nd</SUP> example above it doesn't matter, which hash value (birthday) is found. It is only important that they are equal <!--ZZZFORMEL--> (2<SUP>64 </SUP> ~ 1,8 * 10<SUP>19</SUP>).</P>

<P>Because an effort of  <!--ZZZFORMEL--> 2<SUP>64</SUP>  calculations is possible using a big number of computers working in parallel, 128-bit hash functions are no more considered to be secure for strong cryptography.</P>

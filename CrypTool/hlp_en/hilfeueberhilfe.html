<h3><P><A NAME="hilfeueberhilfe"></A><B>How to use CrypTool help</B></P></h3>

<P>Online help is available for <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="cryptool.html">CrypTool</A> in the normal Windows style (Win help). It is accessed by clicking on the terms contained in the help text which are highlighted (by being underlined and in a different colour), which are hyperlinks.</P>

<P>Clicking on a topic that is continuously underlined will produce a help window on that topic. You can return to the previous topic by clicking on the <B>Back</B> button in the help.</P>

<P>If you click on a topic which has a broken underscore, the current topic will remain in the window and only a small window containing a short explanation will be displayed.</P>

<P>In addition, the <B>Content</B> and <B>Index</B> buttons can also be used to search for subjects or terms.</P>

<P>There is also help on the help itself (Win help), which is designed in exactly the same way as the help for CrypTool. This can be accessed by pressing the <B>F1</B> key when you have opened the CrypTool help and that is the active window, as at this moment.</P>

<P><U>The essential features of the online help are explained in more detail below</U></P>

<P>Using the menu, it is possible to print out individual pages of help and to set various options.</P>

<P>The online help has several facades. The <B>Contents</B> and <B>Index</B> buttons/tabs both open a dialog in which help may be obtained on the desired topic by clicking on the appropriate item.</P>

<P>The online help contains a help page for every dialog and every menu option, and also for all the icons on the toolbar.</P>

<P>Moreover, various tutorials / scenarios / examples (which can be accessed via the <A href="main_index.html">help index</A>, via <A href="hid_hilfe_szenarien.html">scenarios</A> and via the <A class="filelink" onclick="parser('script-en.pdf')">script</A>) can be called up, for example on encryption algorithms or prime numbers.</P>

<P><U>Opening the online help</U></P>

<P>Help for the CrypTool program can be requested in a number of different ways: </P>

<UL>
	<LI>The help module starts up if you press <B>F1</B> when CrypTool is started. On this <B>starting page</B> information is provided on starting work with CrypTool and the functions contained in CrypTool.</LI>

	<LI>If the <B>Contents</B> button is selected from the <B>help</B> menu, the help index is opened. Double clicking on the entries will produce help on various topics. It is also possible to search for particular terms via the <B>Index</B> tab. A full-text search facility is provided on the <B>Find</B> tab.</LI>

	<LI>Context-sensitive help is initiated by pressing <B>F1</B>. In this way one can obtain help on the active window or a particular menu option.</LI>

	<LI>If you press the key combination of <B>Shift+F1</B> or click on the <A href="hid_context_help.html">help icon</A> (this is the icon which shows a mouse pointer and a question-mark) in the <A href="afx_hidw_toolbar.html">toolbar</A>, the mouse pointer will change its appearance (an additional question-mark appears). If you then click on an element in the CrypTool window, the help page which goes with that element will appear.</LI>

	<LI>It is also possible to access the help outside of CrypTool, by double clicking on the CrypTool help file, which is located in the same folder as CrypTool.</LI>
</UL>

<P><U>Closing the online help</U></P>

<P>To close the help, select menu option <B>File \ Close</B>, click on the <A href="hid_sc_close.html">Close icon</A> in the <A href="hid_ht_caption.html">title bar</A> or else press <B>Esc</B>.</P>

<P>When you close down CrypTool, any CrypTool help window will close automatically.</P>

<h3>ADFGVX (Menu <a href="menu_crypt.html">Encrypt/Decrypt</a> \ Symmetric (classic))</h3>

		<p>The ADFGVX encoding method was developed by Fritz Nebel, a colonel of the German 
			communications corps, and it was first employed in spring 1918 by the German 
			army. The procedure is an effective <a href="cascadingcipher.html">cascading cipher</a>, consisting of a 
			substitution followed by a column transposition.<br>
			<br>
			The key input is done in the dialog window <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="hidd_adfgvx.html">key entry: ADFGVX</A>.<br>
			<br>
			The <b>substitution</b> is executed by means of a 6x6-matrix, containing the letters 
			'A' to 'Z' and ciphers '0' to '9' in random order. The rows and columns of the 
			matrix are identified by the letters A, D, F, G, V and X.<br>
			<br>
			Since the substitution matrix is part of the key, it must be known to the 
			recipient of the message. The <b>first encryption stage (substitution)</b> 
			determines the position of each plaintext letter within the matrix and replaces 
			it by its row- and column-indicator. This way, every plaintext letter is 
			replaced by two ciphertext letters.<br>
			<br>
			During the <b>second encryption stage</b> the ciphertext generated in the first stage is further 
			encoded by means of a column transposition. The basis of this transposition is 
			the transposition password, which must consist exclusively of the letters 'A' 
			to 'Z'; redundant characters are not allowed. Thus, the password length is 
			restricted to a maximum of 26 characters.<br>
			<br>
			The transposition password forms the second part of the ADFGVX key. The 
			transposition again is realized through a matrix. The first row is filled with 
			the transposition password, which determines the number of columns. The stage 1 
			ciphertext is then written into the matrix line by line. Now the columns of the 
			matrix are swapped in such a way, that the letters of the transposition 
			password are arranged in alphabetical order. Finally, the stage 2 ciphertext is 
			extracted from the matrix column by column.<br>
			<br>
			The security of this cipher bases on the fact that the two ciphertext letters 
			substituting every plaintext letter are separated by the transposition, 
			making a frequency analysis of the bigrams useless.
			<br>
			<br>
			Thus, using the <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="hid_analyse_symmclassic_adfgvx.html">semi-manual analysis</A>
			included in CrypTool, the transposition has to be solved first, without having 
			a clue about the substitution key.</font></p>

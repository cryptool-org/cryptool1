		<h3>Factorisation attack on RSA</h3>
		<P>The RSA system's security is based on the fact that it is practically impossible 
			to compute from the public RSA modulus N its two prime factors p and q, if N is 
			sufficiently large.</P>
		<P>For small key lengths you can try to factor N into its two prime factors p and 
			q.</P>
		<P>After you have entered the public modulus N and the public key e into the <a href="HID_EINZELVERFAHREN_TUTORIAL_RSAALGORITHMUS.html">
				RSA Demonstration</a> dialog, you can start this factorisation by pressing 
			the button <A href="hid_einzelverfahren_tutorialfrkleinezahlen_faktorisierenifp.html">
				Factorise RSA modulus</A>.</P>
		<P>After successful factorisation the private parameters are entered automatically 
			into the dialog and you can now decrypt and sign data.</P>
		<p><u>Remark</u></p>
		The Dialog "RSA Demonstration" has in his first group (upper boardered area) 
		two radio buttons:
		<UL>
			<li>
			If the upper one is active, you have the view/knowledge of the owner of the 
			private key.
			<li>
				If the lower one is active, you have the view/knowledge of an attack or the 
				receiver of a signed email.
			</li>
		</UL>
		<p>Accodingly the scond group box is changed.</p>
		<p>If you first chose the lower view and then performed as an attack a successful 
			factorisation, the dialog automatically switches into the view of the owner.</p>

<h3>Dialog Exchange Shared Keys</h3>

<P>This dialog window appears after clicking the <B>Exchange shared keys</B> button from within the <a href="hidd_diffiehellmanvisualization.html">Diffie-Hellman Demonstration</a>.</P>

<P>The shared keys of Alice and Bob will be exchanged as soon as you have clicked the <B>OK</B> button.</P>

<P>In practice, Alice sends her shared key A over to Bob and Bob sends his shared key B over to Alice.</P>

<P>Alice and Bob need the their counterpart‚s shared key in order to compute the session key. Therefore it is impossible to calculate the session key without having first exchanged the shared keys of Alice and Bob.</P>

<P>Next to the portrait of Trudy there is a window logging all the important actions Trudy executed during the side-channel attack.</P>

<P>In the list box below you can find all session keys that Trudy created to attack Bob's server. Each of them is based on the original session key and was modified by Trudy according to a certain algorithm.</P>

<P>After completion of the side-channel attack you can find the session key which Alice determined. Trudy uses this session key to decrypt the original message. The result of the decryption is located in the textfield below the session key.</P>

<P>To find a search term in the present <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="dokument.html">document</A> and replace this term by a different text, it is necessary to enter in the <B>Replace</B> dialogue box both the search term and the text which is to replace the search term. If you wish to differentiate between upper and lower case letters, then you should check the <B>Match case</B> field. The search always begins in the present position and moves downwards. Every time the <B>Find Next</B> button is clicked, the system searches for the next occurrence of the search term. The <B>Replace</B> button is used to replace individual instances of the search term with the different text. Clicking on the <B>Replace All</B> button results in global replacement of every occurrence of the search term from the current position by the alternative text.</P>

<P>If the search term is found, it is highlighted. If it could not be found, an audible signal is released. The same applies to <B>Replace</B> and <B>Replace All</B>.</P>

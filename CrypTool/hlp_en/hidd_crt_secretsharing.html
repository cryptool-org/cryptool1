			<P>Dialog<B> Secret Sharing&nbsp;by CRT:&nbsp;Solving a secret with&nbsp;k&nbsp;of n 
					keys</B></P>
		</H3>
		<P>This dialog window can be called via the menu path <a href="menu_related_methods.html">Individual procedures</a> \ <a href="menu_individualprocedures_chineseremaindertheorem.html">Applications 
				of&nbsp;the Chinese Remainder&nbsp;Theorem (CRT)</a> \ <a href="hid_indiv_crt_secretsharing.html">
					Secret Sharing&nbsp;by CRT</a>
		</P>
		<P>
			With this application, you'll be able to try out and understand a&nbsp;(n, 
			k)-Secret Sharing-Threshold&nbsp;Scheme, which distributes a&nbsp;secret on 
			several parties. Here&nbsp;(number-) keys&nbsp;are generated from a secret 
			and&nbsp;distributed on&nbsp;a number&nbsp;of n&nbsp;parties.&nbsp;These keys 
			are public. To rebuild this secret, you don't&nbsp;need to have all keys, but a 
			number of k (which&nbsp;has to be&nbsp;smaller than or&nbsp;equal to&nbsp;n), 
			which is specified before.&nbsp;The <A href="hid_einzelverfahren_crt_definition.html">
				Chinese Remainder Theorem</A>&nbsp;is used in this procedure to calculate 
			the keys. The way it is applied is described <a href="hid_indiv_crt_secretsharing.html">here</a>.

			By clicking <STRONG>Calculate</STRONG> a secret is generated and distributed to 
			a predefined number&nbsp;of n parties (Default for n is 5; the maximum in this 
			dialog is 7). This happens by random-generating of primes&nbsp;and&nbsp;using them in specific way.</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<P><IMG src="images\CrtSecretSharing2a.gif"></P>
		<P><br>
			By clicking <STRONG>Options</STRONG> you get the sub-dialog to&nbsp;view and 
			vary the basic conditions&nbsp;for the distribution of the secret 
			to&nbsp;the&nbsp;n keys.
		</P>
		<P>
			Here, you can specify, how many parties shall get&nbsp;a personal key, how many 
			will be necessary to rebuild&nbsp;the secret,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the range of the 
			prime numbers, which are used.</P>
		<IMG src="images\CrtSecretSharing2b.gif"><br>
		<P>
			The field 'Number of parties&nbsp;given (n)'&nbsp;specifies,&nbsp;how many 
			parties are involved in the distribution. The minimum number is&nbsp;'2', 
			because with a smaller number there wouldn't be a distribution 
			anymore.&nbsp;The biggest number&nbsp;is&nbsp;'7'.&nbsp;This upper limit is not 
			set by the algorithm,&nbsp;but by the dialog gui, because we only want to show 
			the exemplary use of this scheme.
		</P>
		<P>The field 'Number of parties&nbsp;needed&nbsp;(k)'&nbsp;specifies, as it says, 
			the number of parties, which are needed to rebuild the secret.&nbsp;This number 
			has to be&nbsp;bigger than 0 and smaller than&nbsp;or equal to the number of 
			parties given (n).
		</P>
		<P>
			The third&nbsp;option&nbsp;to influence&nbsp;the calculation and distribution 
			is to vary the&nbsp;range for the prime numbers, which are used as 
			identifiers.&nbsp; Here, you're able to set upper and lower limits.&nbsp;To 
			make sure, everything works all right,&nbsp;set the&nbsp;left 
			number&nbsp;(which is the lower limit)&nbsp;smaller than the right 
			one&nbsp;(the upper limit).&nbsp;In this example, the upper limit&nbsp;is set 
			on 2^109 (a 33-digit number). By exceeding this value, the&nbsp;numbers are no 
			more&nbsp;shown completely&nbsp;in the&nbsp;displayed fields.
		</P>
		<P>
			The range of values can be entered as a decimal number or as a power of two ( 
			2^x ).</P>

		<P>By clicking&nbsp;<STRONG>Calc. Steps</STRONG> (Calculation Method) you'll see a 
			sub-dialog, showing all the steps,&nbsp;made to distribute&nbsp;the 
			secret.&nbsp;Every&nbsp;step and every result is shown in&nbsp;here.
		</P>
		<IMG src="images\CrtSecretSharing3b.gif"><br>
		<P>If you want to reconstruct this&nbsp;distribution by yourself,&nbsp;try it by 
			using small numbers and&nbsp;a simple&nbsp;calculator. It'll work.</P>
		<P>All&nbsp;steps and results&nbsp;can also be seen in the&nbsp; <A href="#log-datei">Log-File</A>
			.</P>

		<P>
			Clicking the button <STRONG>Reset</STRONG> in the main dialog, you 
			can&nbsp;reset the dialog&nbsp;to the initial conditions.&nbsp;This contains 
			deleting&nbsp;all textfields in the main dialog&nbsp;and the log-file&nbsp;as 
			well as&nbsp;setting the basic conditions&nbsp;for the distribution of the 
			secret (parties given&nbsp;= 5,&nbsp;parties needed&nbsp;= 3,&nbsp;lower 
			limit&nbsp;= 2^108,&nbsp;upper limit&nbsp;= 2^109).</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<IMG src="images\CrtSecretSharing6.gif"><br>
		<P>
			To have the secret rebuilt, click button <STRONG>Rebuilt secret</STRONG>. 
			Depending on how many and which keys have been provided, the secret can be 
			rebuilt or not. In any case, this procedure will try and a specific event 
			message appears.</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Clicking the button <STRONG>Help</STRONG> will lead you to the

		<a name="#log-datei"></a><IMG src="images\CrtSecretSharing7a.gif"><br>
		<P>
			After clicking <STRONG>Log file</STRONG> a window appears, where all steps, 
			events and results, starting with the distribution of the secret&nbsp;up 
			to&nbsp;the reconstruction, are shown. This contains successful as well as 
			failed reconstructions.&nbsp;If <A href="#zuruecksetzen"><STRONG>Reset</STRONG></A>
			is clicked,&nbsp;the log file will be emptied.
		</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<IMG src="images\CrtSecretSharing8.gif"><br>
		<P>If you click the button <STRONG>Exit</STRONG>, the dialog will be closed 
			and&nbsp;you will be brought back to the CrypTool main window.</P>

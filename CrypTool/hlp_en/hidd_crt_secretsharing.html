<H3>Dialog Secret Sharing&nbsp;by CRT:&nbsp;Solving a secret with&nbsp;k&nbsp;of n keys</H3>

		<P>This dialogue can be called via <B>Individual procedures \ Applications of&nbsp;the 
				Chinese Remainder&nbsp;Theorem (CRT) \ <a href="hid_indiv_crt_secretsharing.html">
					Secret Sharing&nbsp;by CRT</a></B>
		</P>
		<P>
			With this application, you'll be able to try out and understand a&nbsp;(n, 
			k)-Secret Sharing-Threshold&nbsp;Scheme, which distributes a&nbsp;secret on 
			several parties. Here&nbsp;(number-) keys&nbsp;are generated from a secret 
			and&nbsp;distributed on&nbsp;a number&nbsp;of n&nbsp;parties.&nbsp;These keys 
			are public. To rebuilt this secret, you don't&nbsp;need to have all keys, but a 
			number of k (which&nbsp;has to be&nbsp;smaller than or&nbsp;equal to&nbsp;n), 
			which is specified before.&nbsp;The <A href="hid_einzelverfahren_crt_definition.html">
				Chinese Remainder Theorem</A>&nbsp;is used in this procedure to calculate 
			the keys.
		</P>
		<P>
			The exact way of how the keys are generated&nbsp;and the secret is distributed 
			can be viewed by clicking <A href="#rechenweg">Calculation Method</A>. You're 
			able to let the program choose the prime numbers on which the calculation is 
			based and you can choose these numbers by yourself,&nbsp;e.g. to reconstruct 
			literature examples.&nbsp;
		</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<IMG src="images\CrtSecretSharing1.gif">
		<P>
			By clicking <STRONG>Calculate</STRONG> a secret is generated a distributed on a 
			number&nbsp;of parties, which was specified before. If you've chosen an 
			automatic distribution, this happens by random-generating prime-numbers 
			and&nbsp;using them in an&nbsp;algorithm.</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<P><IMG src="images\CrtSecretSharing2.gif"></P>
		<P><br>
			By clicking <STRONG>Options</STRONG> you get the dialogue to&nbsp;view and vary 
			the basic conditions&nbsp;for the distribution on&nbsp;the&nbsp;keys.
		</P>
		<P>
			Here, you can specify, how many parties shall get&nbsp;a personal key, how many 
			will be necessary to rebuild&nbsp;the secret&nbsp;and&nbsp;the number range of 
			the prime numbers, which are used.</P>
		<IMG src="images\CrtSecretSharing2b.gif"><br>
		<P>
			'Number of parties&nbsp;given (n)'&nbsp;specifies,&nbsp;how many parties are 
			involved in the distribution. The minimum number is&nbsp;'2', because with a 
			smaller number there wouldn't be a distribution anymore.&nbsp;The biggest 
			number&nbsp;is&nbsp;'7'.&nbsp;This upper limit is not set by the 
			algorithm,&nbsp;but by the dialogue- and textboxes, because we only want to 
			show the exemplary use of this scheme. If you want more: download the sources 
			and&nbsp;try out&nbsp;by yourself ;-)
		</P>
		<P>
			'Number of parties&nbsp;needed&nbsp;(k)'&nbsp;specifies, as it says, the number 
			of parties, which are needed to rebuild the secret.&nbsp;This number has to 
			be&nbsp;bigger than 0 and smaller than&nbsp;or equal to the number of parties 
			given (n).
		</P>
		<P>
			The third&nbsp;option&nbsp;to influence&nbsp;the calculation and distribution 
			is to vary the number range for the prime numbers, which are used as 
			identifiers.&nbsp; Here, you're able to set upper and lower limits.&nbsp;To 
			make sure, everything works all right,&nbsp;set the&nbsp;left 
			number&nbsp;(which is the lower limit)&nbsp;smaller than the right 
			one&nbsp;(the upper limit).&nbsp;In this example, the upper limit&nbsp;is set 
			on 2^109 (a 33-digit number). By exceeding this value, not all numbers would 
			be&nbsp;shown anymore&nbsp;in the&nbsp;display.
		</P>
		<P>
			The range of values can be entered as a decimal number or as a power of two ( 
			2^x ). In case, the manual distribution for the keys was chosen, the range over 
			values is given by the user. So values in this dialogue will not be relevant.</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<a name="#rechenweg"></a><IMG src="images\CrtSecretSharing3.gif"><br>
		<P>By clicking&nbsp;<STRONG>Calc. Steps</STRONG> you'll see a subdialogue, 
			where&nbsp;the way,&nbsp;made to distribute&nbsp;the secret&nbsp;is 
			shown.&nbsp;Every&nbsp;step and every result is shown in&nbsp;here.
		</P>
		<IMG src="images\CrtSecretSharing3b.gif"><br>
		<P>If you want to reconstruct this&nbsp;distribution by yourself,&nbsp;try it by 
			using small numbers and&nbsp;a simple&nbsp;calculator. It'll work. If you would 
			like to vary this scheme, you can change the values for s and a. After clicking 
			OK, the new scheme will be calculated.</P>
		<P>All&nbsp;steps and results&nbsp;can also be seen in the&nbsp; <A href="#log-datei">Log-File</A>
			.</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<a name="#zuruecksetzen"></a><IMG src="images\CrtSecretSharing4.gif"><br>
		<P>
			Button-clicking <STRONG>Reset</STRONG> in the main dialogue, you can set the 
			reset the dialogue&nbsp;to the initial conditions.&nbsp;This contains 
			deleting&nbsp;all textfields in the main dialogue&nbsp;and the log-file&nbsp;as 
			well as&nbsp;setting the basic conditions&nbsp;for the distribution of the 
			secret (parties given&nbsp;= 5,&nbsp;parties needed&nbsp;= 3,&nbsp;lower 
			limit&nbsp;= 2^108,&nbsp;upper limit&nbsp;= 2^109, distribution will be 
			automatic).</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<IMG src="images\CrtSecretSharing6.gif"><br>
		<P>
			To have the secret rebuilt, button-click <STRONG>Rebuild secret</STRONG>. 
			Depending on how many and which keys have been entered, the secret can be 
			rebuilt or not. Any way, this procedure will try and a specific event message 
			appears.</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<IMG src="images\CrtSecretSharing5.gif"><br>
		<P>Click the Button <STRONG>Help</STRONG>&nbsp;and you will be lead to the 
			beginning of this document.</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<a name="#log-datei"></a><IMG src="images\CrtSecretSharing7a.gif"><br>
		<P>
			After clicking <STRONG>Log file</STRONG> a window appears, where all steps, 
			events and results, starting with the distribution of the secret&nbsp;up 
			to&nbsp;the reconstruction are shown. This contains succeeded as well as failed 
			reconstructions. By Clicking the 'Save'-Button, this log-file will be written 
			in&nbsp;a text-tile at the CrypTool main window.&nbsp;If <A href="#zuruecksetzen"><STRONG>
					Reset</STRONG></A> is clicked,&nbsp;the log-file will be emptied.
		</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<IMG src="images\CrtSecretSharing8.gif"><br>
		<P>If you button-click&nbsp;<STRONG>Exit,</STRONG>&nbsp;the dialogue will be closed 
			and&nbsp;you will be brought back to the CrypTool main window.</P>
		<P>
			Any time, whenever you're not sure what to do, you're able to get a 
			context-specific help by pressing the F1-key.

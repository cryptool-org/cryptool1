		<H3>Dialog Challenge-Response Demonstration</H3>
		<p>You can reach this dialog via the menu entry <a href="menu_related_methods.html">Indiv. 
				Procedures</a> \ <a href="menu_individualprocedures_protocols.html">Protocols</a>
			\ <a href="hid_cr_overview.html">Network Authentication</a>.</p>
		<P>Here the way is described how to handle the
			challenge-response demonstration:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
				By pressing F1 you can get the help for the outline of all challenge-response scenarios.<BR>
				<BR>
			</LI>
			<LI>
				On the left margin there is a series of buttons. By pressing one of them 
				several scenarios (like <b>Password</b>) can be started.<BR>
				<BR>
			</LI>
			<LI>
				Beneath there is the <b>Quit</b> button.<BR>
				<BR>
			</LI>
			<LI>
				On the white surface area some scenarios are demonstrated. A network with 
				following elements form the basis of all scenarios:
				<UL type="disc">
					<LI>
						Squares represent computers and their users. Routers direct data between the 
						nodes of the network. Servers make information and services available to the 
						client.<BR>
					</LI>
					<LI>
						Lines are the network connections between the computers.<BR>
					</LI>
					<LI>
						All elements pictured in blue are normal parts of the networks, red elements 
						belong to the attacker or are subject to his control.</LI>
				</UL>
			</LI>
			<br>
			<LI>
				In the rightmost margin there are buttons for manipulating stations and 
				connections:
				<UL type="disc">
					<LI>
						The empty button means: Select no action.<BR>
					</LI>
					<LI>
						With the buttons <b>Link</b> and <b>Unlink</b> you can influence the status of connections. If 
						you click on connecting and then on one of the router a (red) connection 
						between the attacker and the router will be applied. If you click on separating 
						and then on the connection in progress the red connection will be cleared, blue 
						connection will be displayed as black and separated. Each of both commands can 
						be reversed by the other one.<BR>
					</LI>
					<LI>
						<b>Attack station</b> is possible, when your computer is directly or through network 
						connected to the station. You can assume control over the other computer if it 
						is not well-protected. Server 1 and Client are well-protected, Server 2 and the 
						routers are vulnerable. Attacked computers will be displayed as red and you get 
						a copy of all data saved on this computer. Furthermore, this computer will send 
						you a copy of each incoming data packet.
						<BR>
					</LI>
					<LI>
						If you click on <b>Quit attacking station</b> you cancel the attack and the computer 
						will be displayed as blue again.</LI>
				</UL>
			</LI>
			<br>
			<LI>
				On the left beside the client there is the <b>Authenticate client</b> button which 
				starts the protocol of the chosen scenario.<BR>
				<BR>
			</LI>
			<LI>
				The attacker has an <b>Authenticate attacker</b> button as well. So the attacker 
				(you) can initiate the protocol from his computer and can try to be accepted by 
				the server as client. Needless to say, it works only if the necessary data have 
				been spied out before. Apart from the authentication button there is the <b>Mask</b> 
				button. With the right configuration (which you have to find out) it is 
				possible to identify yourself to the client as server and to the server 
				as client (<A href="man_in_the_middle.html">man-in-the-middle-attack</A>).<BR>
				<BR>
			</LI>
			<LI>
				Down to the right on the white surface area there is the <b>Help for scenario</b> 
				button by which you can have access to specific scenario support sites (and 
				from there to the solutions).<BR>
				<BR>
			</LI>
			<LI>
				To restore the initial state of a scenario press <b>Reset scenario</b>.<BR>
				<BR>
			</LI>
			<LI>
				In the display under the white scenario surface there is a short explanation of 
				the scenario and of the task in each case. Further information and solutions can be 
				accessed by using help.</LI>

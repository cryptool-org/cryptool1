<H3>Operation of Challenge-Response-Module</H3>

<P>By means of this section some operation elements of Challenge-Response-Modules are described:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>By pressing F1 you can get scenario-specific help.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>On the left margin there is a series of buttons. By pressing one of them several scenarios like password can be started.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Beneath the buttons there is one to end the dialog<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>On the white surface area some scenarios are demonstrated. A network with following elements form the basis of all scenarios: 
<UL type="disc">
	<LI>Squares represent computers and their users. Routers direct data between the nodes of the network. Servers make information and services available  to the client.<BR></LI>

	<LI>Lines are the network connections between the computers.<BR></LI>

	<LI>All elements pictured in blue are normal part of the networks, red elements belong to the attacker or are subject to his control.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>

<LI>In the rightmost margin there are buttons for manipulating stations and connections:
<UL type="disc">
<LI>Empty button means choose no action.<BR></LI>

<LI>By connecting and separating you can influence the status of connections. If you click on connecting and then on one of the router a (red) connection between the attacker and the router will be applied. If you click on separating and then on the connection in progress the red connection will be cleared, blue connection will be displayed as black and separated. Each of both commands can be reversed by the other one.<BR></LI>

<LI>Attack station is possible, when your computer is directly or through network connected to the station. You can assume control over the other computer if it is not well-protected. Server 1 and Client are well-protected, Server 2 and the routers are vulnerable. Attacked computers will be displayed as red and you get a copy of all data saved on this computer. Furthermore, this computer will send you a copy of each incoming data packet. <BR></LI>

	<LI>If you click on Quit attacking station you cancel the attack and the computer will be displayed as blue.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>

<LI>On the left beside the client there is the Authentication client button which starts the protocol of the chosen scenario.<BR><BR></LI>

<LI>The attacker has an Authentication attacker button as well. So the attacker (you) can initiate the protocol from his computer and can try to be accepted by the server as client. Needless to say, it works only if the necessary data have been spied out before. Apart from the authentication button there is the Mask button. With the right configuration (which you have to find out) it is possible to identify yourself before the client as server and before the server as client (<A href="man_in_the_middle.html">Man-in-the-Middle-Attack</A>).<BR><BR></LI>

<LI>Down to the right on the white surface area there is the Help for scenario button by which you can have access to specific scenario support sites (and from there to the solutions).<BR><BR></LI>

<LI>To restore the initial state of a scenario press Reset scenario.<BR><BR></LI>

<LI>In the display under the white scenario surface there is a short explanation of the scenario and of the task in each case.  Furthermore information can be accessed by using the help.</LI>

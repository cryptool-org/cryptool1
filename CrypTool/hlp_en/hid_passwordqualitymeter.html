<h3>Password Quality Meter (Menu <a href="menu_related_methods.html">Individual Procedures</a> \ Tools)</h3>

<P>With this menu entry you can access the dialog <a href="hidd_passwordqualitymeter.html">Password Quality Meter</a>.</P>

<P>Users tend to choose simple passwords which are easy to remember. Mostly, these passwords are not secure.</P>

<P>Particularly with regard to password-protected files like archives (ZIP, RAR) or PDF documents, an attacker - once having the document in his hands - has an infinite amount of time to guess the password.</P>

<P>There are commercial as well as free programs you can use to conveniently crack passwords. This is especially useful when you have forgotten your own password and you do not have a decrypted copy of the document.</P>

<P>If you want to use secure passwords which you can remember, then you should have a look into this subject. There are popular tools helping you to choose passwords. These "password quality meters" are little programs that analyze your password and give you feedback instantly.</P>

<P>Often, the feedback is a coloured progress bar ("red" is insecure, "green" is secure), a percentage information or the "password entropy in bit". The CrypTool password quality meter offers all of these indicators. Additionally, CrypTool provides further information (i.e. whether parts of the password can be found in dictionaries).</P>

<P>Unlike most password quality meters, CrypTool doesn't only analyze each character independently, but penalizes the password quality when the password consists of dictionary entries, serials like "1234" or patterns like "ghjghjghj": Because in such a case an attacker can reach his goal much faster.</P>

<P>Just try out the following strategy for choosing passwords: Think of a sentence and insert the 
initials of every word - with regard to case sensitivity - in the password. Example: The sentence 
"My password shall not be hacked within one hour!" leads to the password "Mpsnbhw1h!".</P>

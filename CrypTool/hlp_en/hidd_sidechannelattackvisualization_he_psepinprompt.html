<h3>Dialog PIN prompt</h3>

<P>In order to decrypt the hybrid encrypted message, you need the session key which was encrypted with Bob's public key.</P>

<P><U>Only</U> Bob is supposed to be able to decrypt the message, therefore Bob's private key is protected by his personal PIN.</P>

<p><b>Remark</b>:</p>

<p>If you did <u>not</u> execute the hybrid encryption on you own, Bob's personal PIN is <b>1234</b> by default.</p>

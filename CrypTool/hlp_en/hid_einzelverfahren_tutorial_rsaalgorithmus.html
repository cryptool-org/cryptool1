<h3>Dialog RSA Cryptosystem</h3>

<P>The most well-known asymmetric cryptosystem is the RSA algorithm, named after its authors, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman. In this dialog you can carry out all three steps of the RSA cryptosystem:</P>

<OL>

	<LI><A href="rsa_demo_key_generation.html">RSA key generation </A>,<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI><A href="RSA_demo_encryption.html">RSA encryption of messages</A> and<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI><A href="RSA_demo_decryption.html">RSA decryption of messages</A>.<BR><BR></LI>

</OL>

<P>For <A href="public_rsa_parameter.html">RSA encryption and RSA signature verification</A> it is sufficient to enter the public parameters: </P>

<UL>

	<LI> the RSA modulus N and</LI>

	<LI> the public RSA exponent e.<BR><BR></LI>

</UL>

<P>In this case the secret parameters (the Euler phi function of N and the secret key) don't need not to be known.</P>

<P>You can use the upper group box <B>RSA using the private and public key – or using only the public key</B> to indicate how much information is known.</P>

<P>The following default settings are used after each start of CrypTool: </P>

<UL>

	<LI>In the dialog "The RSA Cryptosystem" all fields are blank except for "2^16+1" in the field of the public key e.</LI>

	<LI>In the dialog "Options for RSA Encryption" by default the alphabet consists of the 256 characters of the 8bit ASCII code.<BR><BR></LI>

</UL>

<P>The values of the prime numbers, the RSA parameters and the options are retained if the dialog is closed and invoked again, as long as the CrypTool application is not terminated. So you do not have to enter them again if they shall be used a second time. But you always can modify them.</P>

<P>In order to confidentially transmit a message, the public key of the recipient must be known. The procedure of encoding the message with the recipients public key for privacy reasons is called encryption. </P>

<P>It is a special property of the RSA cryptosystem, that <A href="rsa_demo_signature.html">digital signatures</A> can be created with same operation, if the private key of the signer is used instead of the public key of the recipient. Everyone can then verify using the holder's public key, that the signature was generated by the holder of the corresponding private key.</P>

<P>The story, <A href="rsa_demo_variant.html">The Dialog of the Sisters</A> [c‚t magazine, issue 25/99], describes a variant of the RSA cryptosystem that is suitable for hand calculation. This variant can be selected under <A href="hidd_options_rsa_demo.html">Options for the alphabet and the number system</A> after a small RSA key has been generated.</P>

<P>The example below illustrates the RSA encryption of the following message:</P>

<P>"Sell my shares on 14 July 2000 and use the sales revenues to buy me a South Sea island".</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/rsa_demo_1.gif" ALT="rsa_demo_1.gif" BORDER=0></P>

<P>This encryption operation needs the following steps:</P>

<P>First of all the two prime numbers p and q have to be chosen (the simplest way to achieve this is to click on <A href="hid_einzelverfahren_tutorial_primzahlengenerieren.html">Generate prime numbers</A>), then the public key e has to be entered. After that the secret key d can be calculated by clicking on "Update parameters".</P>

<P>Prior to carrying out the encryption or decryption you can make further adjustments to the settings for encryption in the <A href="hidd_options_rsa_demo.html">Options for the alphabet and the number system</A> dialog: </P>

<UL>

	<LI>Alphabet options</LI>

	<LI>The "Dialog of the Sisters" RSA variant</LI>

	<LI>The number system in which the numbers for RSA encryption and decryption are to be presented<BR><BR></LI>

</UL>

<P>To initiate encryption, entered the plaintext and then click on the <B>Encrypt</B> button. </P>

<h3>Dialog Analysis of a Single Column Transposition (Known Plaintext)</h3>

<P>You can reach this dialog via the menu entry <a href="menu_analyze.html">Analysis</a> \ <a href="menu_analysis_symmetricclassic.html">Symmetric Encryption (classic)</a> \ <a href="menu_analysis_symmetricclassic_knownplaintext.html">Known Plaintext</a> \ <a href="hid_known_analysis_single_permutation.html">Single Column Transposition</a>.</P>

<P>This dialog is used to enter the needed data for automatic analysis (<!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="knownplaintextangriff.html">known-plaintext attack</A>) 
for <A href="hid_permutation_asc.html">encryption by permutation</A>.</P>

<P>You have to select the plaintext and ciphertext into this dialog.</P>

<P>Using permutation encryption the text is normally entered row by row in a table of width n (= length of permutation). 
The ciphertext is now read column by column in the sequence defined by the permutation. Compared to the classic variant, 
in CrypTool it is possible to read in and read out the plaintext in either columns or rows. Additionally it is possible to determine
if the permutation itself is to be carried out line by line or column by column. Column by column is the default here. 
In the literature sometimes a line by line notation is used. If all three options are toggled the result does not change, as this constitutes an equivalent setting.</p>

<p>You have the option of limiting the dimension of the key to be searched for. If you know the length of the key, 
then you can instruct the program to confine the analysis to this key length. This can save a lot of time, especially if the document is large. 
However, you should note, this means e.g. a key of dimension 3 will not be found if you limit the dimension to 1 or 2.</p>

<p>To start the analysis click on <b>Continue</b>; to terminate the analysis click on <b>Cancel</b>.</p>

<p>If CrypTool was able to find the key, it will be displayed in the dialog <A href="hidd_automated_perm_analysis_output.html">Single Column Transposition Key</A>; otherwise a message that the key could not be found will appear.

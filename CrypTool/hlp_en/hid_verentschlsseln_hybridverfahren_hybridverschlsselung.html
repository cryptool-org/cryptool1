<h3><P><A NAME="hid_verentschlsseln_hybridverfahren_hybridverschlsselung"></A><B>Hybrid encryption (Menu <A href="menu_crypt.html">Crypt/Decrypt</A> \ Hybrid)</B></P></h3>

<P>The dialog <A href="hidd_hybrid_encryption_demo.html">Visualising hybrid encryption</A> is initialised with the active document (if any).</P>

<P>The goal of the hybrid method is to compensate the respective disadvantages of symmetric and asymmetric encryption and to combine their advantages.</P>

<P>The main problem of all symmetric encryption algorithms is the <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="keyexchange.html">key management</A> for a large number of secret keys (one for each pair of communicating parties). Asymmetric cryptography solves this problem. Symmetric algorithms on the other hand are much faster than the asymmetric ones.</P>

<P>Asymmetric encryption systems are, due to their large computational requirements, used in practice only for encrypting so called "session keys". The pay load is encrypted with a symmetric algorithm using the session key. This combination of two methods is called hybrid encryption (asymmetric/symmetric). This implies no security deficit if you use a good random number generator for the session key.</P>

<P>In <B>hybrid encryption systems</B> the sender "A" creates in a secure environment a "random", i.e. not predictable, symmetric key "S" (the so called "session key") and encrypts the message using this key. The sender then encrypts the session key with the (asymmetric) public key of the recipient "B". Then both, the message encrypted with "S" and the encrypted session key are transmitted to the recipient.</P>

<P>Recipient "B" not knowing the session key, has to decrypt the encrypted session key before he can decrypt the message. He decrypts "S" with his (asymmetric) private key. Now he knows the session key and can use it to decrypt the message that was sent to him. </P>

<P><!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="pgp.html">PGP</A> e.g is based on the hybrid encryption scheme. It uses <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="hid_crypt_idea.html">IDEA</A> for encrypting the data symmetrically and <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="hid_crypt_rsaenc.html">RSA</A> to transport the session key securely.</P>

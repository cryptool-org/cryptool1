<P><U>What is CrypTool?</U></P>

<P><!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="cryptool.html">CrypTool</A> is a <B>freeware</B> program which enables you to apply and analyse cryptographic mechanisms.</P>

<P>CrypTool contains an exhaustive <A href="main_index.html">online help</A>, which can be understood without deep knowledge in cryptography, therefore no printed user manual on how to use CrypTool is provided. CrypTool is <B>completely</B> available in <B>English and German</B>. CrypTool has implemented almost all state-of-the-art crypto functions and allows you to learn about and use, modern and classic <B>cryptography</B> within the same environment.</P>

<P>The methods available include both <!--ZZZUL-->

<UL>
	<LI>classical methods (e.g. the <A href="hid_caesar_asc.html">Caesar</A>  and the<A href="hid_permutation_asc.html"> double-column transposition (permutation)</A> encryption algorithms) and <BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>modern <A href="crypto_methods.html">cryptosystems</A> (for example, the <A href="hid_crypt_rsaenc.html">RSA</A> and <A href="aes_gewinner.html">AES</A> algorithms, as well as algorithms based on <A href="ellipkurven.html">elliptic curves</A>). <!--ZZZULE--></LI>
</UL>

<P>A summary of all the <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="verschlverfahren.html"><B>encryption algorithms</B></A> available in CrypTool is contained on the help page for the <A href="menu_crypt.html">Crypt</A> menu.</P>

<P>Automatic analysis tools for obtaining the <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="schluessel.html">key</A>, starting from a knowledge of the encrypted document and any additional information (the unencrypted document or the language of the document), are provided for the classical encryption algorithms. For additional information on automatic analysis, go to the help screen for the <A href="menu_analyze.html">Analysis</A> menu and choose the encryption algorithm to be analysed there.</P>

<P>To support your own analysis of documents, CrypTool can display a <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="histogramm.html">histogram</A> of the document, determine the statistics for any <A href="hid_analyse_ngram.html">N-grams</A> and calculate <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="entropie.html">entropy</A> and <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="autokorrelation.html">autocorrelation</A>.</P>

<P>In the menu <A href="menu_related_methods.html"><B>Indiv. Procedures</B></A> single different methods and protocols are offered: <!--ZZZUL-->

<UL>
	<LI>calculate <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="hashwert.html">hash values</A> (see menu <B>Indiv. Procedures \ <A href="menu_hash.html">Hash</A></B>).<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI><A href="hid_zip.html">compress</A> and <A href="hid_unzip.html">decompress</A> documents. This enables the study of file compression prior to the actual encryption of a given document.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>generate or analyse <A href="hid_zufall_generatoren.html">random numbers</A>.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>find out, how strong keys can be generated according the <A href="hid_einzelverfahren_schluesselgenerieren.html">PKCS#5</A> standard from passwords. <!--ZZZULE--></LI>
</UL>

<P>The further menu items are described below.</P>

<P>The RSA cryptosystem (see menu <B>Indiv. Procedures \ <A href="menu_tutorial_for_small_numbers.html">RSA demonstration</A></B>) is covered comprehensively and implemented for different codings. The RSA key is generated from prime numbers created by the user. Key generation, encryption and decryption can be followed step-by-step.</P>

<P>Factorisation of numbers is also an important application for cryptography. Simple RSA cryptosystems can be easily cracked using the factorisation algorithms presented in CrypTool. Thus you get an idea how long keys of secure systems should be at least.</P>

<P>Within CrypTool most of the modern algorithms are implemented according international <A href="standards.html">standards</A>.</P>

<P>The <A href="menu_structure.html">menus and sub menus</A> of CrypTool are dynamically generated, depending on the opened file‚s type. E.g. you will only find the menu item "XOR" below "Analysis \ Ciphertext-Only" if a binary file is currently selected. Accordingly the item "Hash \ Hash demo" can only be found under the menu "Individual Procedures", if a text file is opened.</P>

<P>An overview about all menu items within CrypTool can be found within the <A href="menu_structure.html">menu tree</A>.</P>

<P>The authors of CrypTool did not implement cryptographic functionality, where very good free programs were available in the Internet: so the Enigma cipher and dictionary attacks against password files (see John-the-Ripper, http://www.openwall.com/john/) are not part of CrypTool yet.</P>

<P><U>Online help, documentation and tutorials</U></P>

<P>During the development of CrypTool much care has been taken to ensure that context sensitive help is available at any point by pressing the <B>F1</B> key. You can get a fast overview, if you open a file and move through the menu items: whenever interested click <B>F1</B> to see details about this menu item.</P>

<P>The extensive online help explains all basic cryptographic terms, contains a short <A href="literatur.html">list of references</A> and provides a historic overview of the development of cryptography within the <A href="menu_zeittafel.html">time-table</A>.</P>

<P>The <A href="hid_hilfe_szenarien.html">examples</A> (tutorials) provided with the online help will make it easy for you to get up to speed.</P>

<P>A big support for raising a deeper understanding of the following topics are the interactive demonstrations (<A href="visualizations.html">visualizations</A>): <!--ZZZUL--></P>

<P>-creating an electronic signature,</P>

<P>-processing hybrid encryption,</P>

<P>-how changes to a document change the hash value <!--ZZZUL--></P>

<P>-sensitivity of hash algorithms,</P>

<P>-generation of hash value collisions (birthday paradox) and <!--ZZZULE--></P>

<P>-processing the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.</P>

<P><!--ZZZULE--></P>

<P>Beside the online help CrypTool provides 4 additional files with documentation: <!--ZZZUL--></P>

<P>-The readme file (<!--ZZZLINK--><A href="readme-en.txt">readme-en.txt</A>) contains all important elements of the CrypTool package and a description of the project.</P>

<P>-In the <!--ZZZLINK--><A href="script-en.pdf">script</A> (provided as a PDF file with more than 100 pages) you will find more, somewhat mathematically oriented information <!--ZZZUL--></P>

<P>-on cryptographic methods,</P>

<P>-on prime numbers,</P>

<P>-on elementary number theory with many examples and</P>

<P>-on current results of the cryptanalytic research. <!--ZZZULE--></P>

<P>-The <!--ZZZLINK--><A href="CrypToolPresentation_1_3_03_en.pdf">CrypTool presentation</A> with over 30 slides gives an overview about the CrypTool project.</P>

<P>-Also included is the story <!--ZZZLINK--><A href="DialogueSisters.pdf">The Dialogue of the Sisters</A> by Dr. Carsten Elsner. Within this fantasy story a variant of the RSA cryptosystem is used.</P>

<P><!--ZZZULE--></P>

<P><U>Organizational</U></P>

<P>CrypTool was developed jointly by companies and universities to provide an adequate teaching aid and for the end user awareness programme aimed at raising the IT security awareness of staff and helping them to gain a deeper understanding of the concept of security. </P>

<P>Another objective was to demonstrate the cryptographic techniques employed in Deutsche Bank. Thus it is possible with CrypTool, as a reliable reference implementation of the various encryption algorithms, to test the encryption used in other programs. With this tool it is therefore possible to check whether claims that a program encrypts appropriately are founded or not.</P>

<P>The <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="hashfunktion.html">hash functions</A>, the symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms and the key management facilities are based on the Secude toolkit (version 5.4.15) developed by <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="secude.html">Secude GmbH</A>.</P>

<P>The enclosed Secude library is restricted through the ticket file to a key length of 768 bits for the asymmetric algorithms and smart card support is disabled. If you have a Secude library licence you will also be able to use longer key lengths with the asymmetric methods with the aid of your ticket file. </P>

<P>In order to demonstrate the RSA cryptosystem and to factorise integers CrypTool uses the long integer arithmetic of the Miracl library (version 4.4.3) from Shamus Software Ltd. (http://indigo.ie/~mscott/). We restricted the integer bit length up to 1024.</P>

<P>In order to demonstrate the hash-collisions (using the birthday paradox) the OpenSLL library libeay32.dll is used.</P>

<P>Please note the <A href="gewaehrleistung.html">information regarding liability for any damage arising from the use of CrypTool</A>.</P>

<P><A NAME="licence_terms"></A><U>Terms of the licence</U></P>

<P><B><a name="whatiscryptool">What is CrypTool?</a></B></P>

<P><!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="cryptool.html">CrypTool</A> is a <B>freeware</B> program which enables you to apply and analyse cryptographic mechanisms. It has the typical look-and-feel of a modern windows application.</P>

<P>CrypTool contains an exhaustive <A href="main_index.html">online help</A>, which can be understood without deep knowledge in cryptography, therefore no printed user manual on how to use CrypTool is provided. <br>
CrypTool is <B>completely</B> available in <B>English and German</B>. CrypTool has implemented almost all state-of-the-art crypto functions and allows you to learn about and use, modern and classic <B>cryptography</B> within the same environment.</P>

<P>The methods available include both classical methods and modern cryptosystems:</P>
<UL>
<li>	classical: e.g. the <A href="hid_rot13caesar_asc.html">Caesar</A> cipher, the <A href="hid_encrypt_adfgvx.html">ADFGVX</A> cipher and the <A href="hid_permutation_asc.html">double-column transposition (permutation)</A> encryption algorithm.
<li>	modern: for example, the <A href="hid_crypt_rsaenc.html">RSA</A> and <A href="aes_gewinner.html">AES</A> algorithms, hybrid encryption and algorithms based on <A href="menu_analysis_asymmetric_latticebasedattacks.html">lattice reduction</A> and <A href="ellipkurven.html">elliptic curves</A>. 
</UL>

<P>A summary of all the <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="verschlverfahren.html"><B>encryption algorithms</B></A> available in CrypTool is contained on the help page for the <A href="menu_crypt.html">Crypt/Decrypt</A> menu.</P>

<p>If you encrypt a document the result will be shown in a new sub-window: The title of the resulting window contains both the name of the original document and the encryption key used. The usage of keys is supported by two special icons: Clicking the icon "Show key" <img
src="images/keycopy.png"> allows you to copy the used key from a resulting window into an internal storage. If you then encrypt another document with the same encryption method the icon "Insert key" <img
src="images/keypaste.png"> is active within the key entry dialog box. This is helpful, especially with more complex keys.</p>

<P>Automatic analysis tools for obtaining the <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="schluessel.html">key</A>, starting from a knowledge of the encrypted document and any additional information (the unencrypted document or the language of the document), are provided for the classical encryption algorithms. For additional information on automatic analysis, request online help for the <A href="menu_analyze.html">Analysis</A> menu and choose the encryption algorithm to be analysed there.</P>

<P>To support your own analysis of documents, CrypTool can display a <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="histogramm.html">histogram</A> of the document, determine the statistics for any <A href="hid_analyse_ngram.html">N-grams</A> and calculate <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="entropie.html">entropy</A> and <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="autokorrelation.html">autocorrelation</A>.</P>

<p>The encryption functions within the menu <A href="menu_crypt.html">Crypt/Decrypt</A> are implemented in a way that they can be called and performed efficiently. <br>
On the other hand the functon in the menu <A href="menu_related_methods.html">Indiv. Procedures</A> are implemented in a way that they can be performed step by step and interactively. Here the eLearning aspect is the main focus.</p>

<P>In the menu <A href="menu_related_methods.html">Indiv. Procedures</A> single different methods and protocols are offered:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>calculate <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="hashwert.html">hash values</A> (see menu Indiv. Procedures \ <A href="menu_individualprocedures_hashprocedures.html">Hash</A>) and show their sensitivity.</LI>
	<LI>create <A href="hid_generate_macs.html">Message Authentication Codes (MACs).</A></LI>
	<LI>find out, how strong keys can be generated according the <A href="hid_einzelverfahren_schluesselgenerieren.html">PKCS#5</A> standard from passwords.</LI>
	<LI><A href="hid_zip.html">compress</A> and <A href="hid_unzip.html">decompress</A> documents. This enables the study of file compression prior to the actual encryption of a given document.</LI>
	<LI>generate or analyse <A href="hid_zufall_generatoren.html">random numbers.</A></LI>
	<LI>demonstrate protocols for <A href="hid_cr_overview.html">authentication</A> und <A href="hid_einzelverfahren_diffiehellmandemo.html">key exchange (DH).</A></LI>
	<LI>find out how an ancient number theoretic theorem (<A href="menu_individualprocedures_chineseremaindertheorem.html">Chinese Remainder Theorem</A>) can be applied (e.g. when are the planets of our solar system positioned in one straight line).</LI>
	<LI>step through some ciphers forward and backwards (using <A href="menu_individualprocedures_visualizationwithanimal.html">ANIMAL</A>).</LI>
	<LI>apply common encodings like <A href="hid_code_base64.html">base64</A> and <A href="hid_code_uu.html">uuencode.</A></LI>
</UL>

<P>The remaining menu items in the main menu "Individual Procedures" are described below (see RSA Cryptosystem and Visualizations). </P>

<p>Which menu items can be selected depends on the type of the active document. The menus and sub-menus of CrypTool are dynamically generated, depending on the opened file's type (binary or text). All menu items are visible all the time, but only the ones, which fit to current document type can be selected. The remaining menu items are disabled. E.g., the menu item "XOR" below "Analysis \ Ciphertext-Only" can only be selected if a binary file is currently open. Accordingly the item "Individual Procedures \ Hash \ Hash demo" can only be selected, if a text file is opened.</p>

<p>An overview of all menu items within CrypTool can be found in the <A href="menu_structure.html">menu tree.</a></p>

<p>Within CrypTool the modern algorithms are implemented according to international standards.</p>

<P>The authors of CrypTool did not implement cryptographic functionality, where very good free programs were available in the Internet: So the Enigma cipher and dictionary attacks against password files (see John-the-Ripper, http://www.openwall.com/john/) are not part of CrypTool yet.</P>

<br><P><B><a name="rsa">The RSA Cryptosystem</a></B></P>

<P>The RSA cryptosystem (see menu Indiv. Procedures \ RSA Cryptosystem \ <A href="hid_einzelverfahren_tutorial_rsaalgorithmus.html">RSA demonstration</A>) is covered comprehensively and implemented for different codings. The RSA key is generated from prime numbers created by the user. Key generation, encryption and decryption can be followed step-by-step.</P>

<P>Factorisation of numbers is also an important application for cryptography. Simple RSA cryptosystems can be easily cracked using the factorisation algorithms presented in CrypTool. Thus, you get an idea of the minimum length of keys necessary for secure systems.</P>

<br><P><B><a name="demo">Interactive Demonstrations / Visualizations</a></B></P>
<p>This interactive demonstrations (<A href="visualizations.html">visualizations</a>) are helpful for raising a deeper understanding of the following topics: 
<ul>
<li>creating an <A href="hid_einzelverfahren_sign_doc.html">electronic signature.</a></li>

<br><P><B><a name="organization">Organizational</a></B></P>

<P>CrypTool was developed jointly by companies and universities to provide an adequate teaching aid and for the end user awareness programme aimed at raising the IT security awareness of staff and helping them to gain a deeper understanding of the concept of security. </P>

<P>Another objective was to demonstrate the cryptographic techniques employed in Deutsche Bank. Thus it is possible with CrypTool, as a reliable reference implementation of the various encryption algorithms, to test the encryption used in other programs. With this tool it is therefore possible to check whether claims that a program encrypts appropriately are founded or not.</P>

<P>The <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="hashfunktion.html">hash functions</A>, the symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms and the key management facilities are based on the Secude toolkit (version 7.4.46C) developed by <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="secude.html">Secude IT Security GmbH</A>.</P>

<P>The enclosed Secude library is restricted through the ticket file to a key length of 768 bits for the asymmetric algorithms and smart card support is disabled. If you have a Secude library licence you will also be able to use longer key lengths with the asymmetric methods with the aid of your ticket file. </P>

<P>In order to demonstrate the RSA cryptosystem and to factorise integers CrypTool uses the long integer arithmetic of the Miracl library (version 4.4.3) from Shamus Software Ltd. (<a href="http://indigo.ie/~mscott/">http://indigo.ie/~mscott/</a>). We restricted the integer bit length up to 1024.</P>

<P>In order to demonstrate the hash-collisions (using the birthday paradox) the library libeay32.dll from OpenSSL (<a href="http://www.openssl.org/">http://www.openssl.org/</a>) is used.</P>

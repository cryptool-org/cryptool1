		<h3>Modular Forward and Backward Transformation (Menu <A href="menu_related_methods.html">
				Individual Procedures</A> \ Chinese Remainder Theorem Applications)</h3>
		<P>The dialog window <A href="hidd_crt_transformation.html">modular transformation</A>
			shows the <A href="hid_einzelverfahren_crt_definition.html">Chinese Remainder 
				Theorem</A> calculation with the modular remainders. In addition, the 
			original numbers are transformed into these remainders and after the 
			calculation of the remainders, their result is reconverted again into a 
			“normal“ number.</P>
		<P>The dialog offers multiplication, addition or subtraction of two numbers A and B 
			as mathematical operation. In normal practice it is used, if the memory for the 
			representation of large numbers and their intermediate results is not 
			sufficient and to speed up calculations.</P>
		<P>In comparison to conventional number notation the idea of the modular arithmetic 
			consists in selecting t different <U>modules</U> m<SUB>1</SUB>, m<SUB>2</SUB>, 
			…, m<SUB>t </SUB>, which are <U>pairwise relatively prime</U> and to perform 
			the calculation on remainders x <EM>mod</EM> m<SUB>1</SUB>, x <EM>mod </EM>m<SUB>2</SUB>, 
			..., x <EM>mod</EM> m<SUB>t </SUB>instead of directly with the whole number x.</P>
		<P>This is possible, because&nbsp;the modular representation uses the same arithmetic rules&nbsp;(addition, subtraction and multiplication). 
			The&nbsp;range, that can be represented by modular arithmetic, goes from 0 to 
			(m<SUB>1</SUB> &#8729; m<SUB>2</SUB> &#8729; … &#8729; m<SUB>t</SUB>)-1.</P>
		<P>This procedure has the additional advantage of allowing&nbsp;operations to be 
			distributed to different computers and carrying them out in parallel.</P>
		<P>Further details about modular arithmetic can be found in the CrypTool <A class="filelink" onclick="parser('script-en.pdf')">script</A>
				, chapter 4.</P>

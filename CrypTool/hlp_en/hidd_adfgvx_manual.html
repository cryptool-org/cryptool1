<h3>Dialog Semiautomatic Analysis of the ADFGVX Cipher </h3>

<P>You can reach this dialog via the menu entry <A href="menu_analyze.html">Analysis</A> \ <a href="menu_analysis_symmetricclassic.html">Symmetric Encryption (classic)</a> \ <a href="menu_analysis_symmetricclassic_ciphertextonly.html">Ciphertext-Only</a> \ <a href="HID_ANALYSE_SYMMCLASSIC_ADFGVX.html">ADFGVX</a>.</P>



		<p>This dialog window supports you in analysing <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="hid_encrypt_adfgvx.html">ADFGVX 
				encrypted</A> messages.<br>
			The theoretical basis to analyze the ADFGVX cipher can be found <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="hid_analyse_symmclassic_adfgvx.html">here</A>.<br>
			<br>
			Just like the dialog <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="hidd_adfgvx.html">ADFGVX Cipher: Key 
				Input</A>, this dialog is divided into two sections, in which the two 
			stages of ADFGVX can be analyzed. However, the analysis of ADFGVX must be 
			carried out in reverse order: At first, the transposition (encryption step 2) 
			is analyzed, the second phase consists of analysing the substitution 
			(encryption step 1) and possibly you may discover that the transposition 
			password is not correct.<br>

		<p><font face="Arial"><b>Step 2: Finding the Transposition Password</b><br>
				<br>
				The dropdown fields for the <b>Password length</b> control the lower and upper 
				boundaries of the brute-force search for the transposition password. A large 
				search area will lead to a long wait while the computer works its way to the 
				upper boundary (as a reminder: a maximum password length of 6 characters 
				results in 1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + 5! + 6! = 873 possible combinations). As a rule 
				of thumb, passwords with a length up to 11 characters (43,954,713 possible 
				solutions) will be found in an acceptable time.<br>
				<br>
				The edit field <b>Current password</b> shows the current transposition password.<br>
				Passwords found by the automatic analysis always consist of the first <i>n</i> letters 
				of the alphabet, <i>n</i> being the password length. Thus, the passwords 
				"MATRIX" and "CAEDBF" are equivalent. If the field is empty when beginning the 
				analysis, the search will cover the whole range defined by the minimal and 
				maximal password length fields. If a password is entered, the search will begin 
				with the given password and stop at the upper boundary. For example, with the 
				given password "CAEBDF" and an upper boundary of seven characters, the search 
				will terminate with the combination "GFEDCBA".<br>
				Entries made in this field will deny changes in the password length fields that 
				stand in contrast to the current password. For example, while the maximal 
				password length can be greater than the current length, it cannot be smaller.<br>
				<b>To begin a new search within other boundaries, the current password must be 
					erased or changed.</b><br>
				Below the password text field, the current sequence for the column 
				transposition is displayed.<br>
				<br>
				The button <b>Apply</b> bypasses the analysis of the transposition password. 
				This is especially useful with short messages, since in this case the bigram 
				analysis is unlikely to deliver a meaningful result. The entered password can 
				be used to transpose the message without being tested first. The bigram 
				analysis is carried out anyway, but not in order to assess the password. The 
				entries made into the substitution matrix can be faulty, they represent the 
				best, but not necessarily a good result of the analysis.<br>
				As long as no password is given in <b>Current password</b>, the button is 
				deactivated.<br><br>
				By clicking the button <b>Analyze</b>, the brute-force search for the 
				transposition key is started, beginning at the lower boundary or the current 
				password and stopping when it finds a possible password or reaching the upper 
				boundary.<br>
				For determining a possible solution, the current implementation searches for the  
				ADFGVX bigram with the highest relative frequency, matching it to the equivalent 
				character from the reference text selected in CrypTool text options. 
				In spite of this very crude criterion, there is almost 
				no occurrance of false alarms (disregarding the cases of pair wise <A href="hid_analyse_symmclassic_adfgvx.html#column_shift">
					column shifts</A>).<br>
				<br>
				<b>Step 1: Finding the Substitution Key</b><br>
				<br>
				If a possible solution is found, the search stops and the substitution matrix is 
				filled, using a histogram generated from the reference text selected in the text options dialog<br>
				<br>
				The <b>Current solution</b> of the analysis is displayed at the bottom of the 
				dialog, small letters indicate the parts that are already resubstituted, 
				capital letters are ADFGVX bigrams. The first bigram letter marks the row, the 
				second marks the column of the plaintext letter in the substitution matrix.<br>
				<br>The user now has to try to detect whole words in the text and assign 
			the missing plaintext letters to the ADFGVX bigrams.</p>
		<p>The <b>Substitution matrix</b> can only contain the letters 'A' to 'Z' and the 
			figures '0' to '9'. On repeated entry of an existing character, a dialog box is 
			displayed, giving the user the possibility to erase the old entry or to undo 
			the change.<br>
			The button <b>Clear matrix</b> erases all entries of the substitution matrix. 
			The button <b>Standard matrix</b> fills the substitution matrix with all 36 
			allowed characters in order.<br>
			<br>
			Since the field <STRONG>Current solution</STRONG> is not updated dynamically, 
			clicking the button <b>Update current solution</b> will do just this.<br>
			<br>
			If, by looking at the text, one does not discover any meaningful words, the 
			transposition password may be incorrect. In this case the transposition 
			analysis must be resumed by clicking <b>Analyze</b> and the substitution 
			analysis must be restarted with the next possible transposition password.<br>
			This step can be repeated until the upper boundary of the password search is 
			reached.<br>

			<br>
			Clicking on the <b>insert key icon</b>
			<IMG SRC="images/iconinsertkey.gif" ALT="iconinsertkey.gif" BORDER=0>
		       	inserts an ADFGVX key that was previously copied 
			to the <a href="keystore.html">internal key store</a> (if the button is 
			inactive/gray, there is no ADFGVX key available).<br>

			<br>
			By clicking the&nbsp; <b>Output</b> button the current solution is written to a 
			new text window and the analysis dialog is closed.<br>
			<br>
			The checkbox <b>Show opening dialog</b> determines, whether the short 
			information about how to analyze an ADFGVX-message is displayed when opening 
			the dialog. </FONT></p>

<P>A lot of cryptographic applications are password-based, e.g. login (authentication with passwords). A dictionary attack is a simple method of attacking such applications. The idea behind a dictionary attack is that the choice of passwords is not evenly distributed, as a rule. Typically, the user chooses a familiar term as the password, as such passwords are easy to remember. However, one should be aware that a modern computer can try out 100,000 terms from a dictionary in a matter of only a few seconds. A password that is chosen from the dictionary is therefore a major security weakness. More sophisticated dictionary attack programs combine attacks from the dictionary with one or two other ASCII characters, enabling them to crack more effectively selected passwords such as</P>

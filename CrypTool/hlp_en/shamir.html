<h3>(t, n) Shamir scheme</h3>

<P>This well-known threshold scheme was discovered in 1979 by Adi Shamir. It's a form of <A 
href="hid_einzelverfahren_secretsharingdemo.html">secret sharing</A> that is 
based on polynomials over finite fields.</P>
<P>Threshold t is the number of shares needed to successfully reconstruct the 
secret. n is the number of participants an p is a prime that has to be bigger 
than the number of participants and the secret K to be shared among them.</P>
<P>To set up a Shamir scheme, the dealer has to go through the following 
steps:</P>
<UL>
<LI>He chooses n different elements from the finite field GF(p). Each 
participant is assigned one of these numbers as his or her public value x. 
<LI>Further, the dealer chooses t-1 elements at random that are kept secret. A 
polynomial f(x) is created that intersects the y-axis in (0, K) and whose 
coefficients are the previously selected elements. Thus the resulting polynomial 
is of degree t-1 and of the form f(x) = K + a1*x + a2*x^2 + ... + at-1*x^t-1. 
<LI>Last, the dealer comutes the participants' secret shares by evaluating the 
polynomial for every point x. All shares lie in the intervall from 0 to p-1 as 
all calculations are executed <A href="modulo.html">modulo</A> p. The dealer 
securely transfers each share to its owner. </LI></UL>
<P>To reconstruct the secret, at least t participants have to cooperate. First, 
these participants have to transfer their shares to the combiner. Now he is the 
one who not only knows all public values, but t secret values, too. As a result, 
he is able to compute the secret by using a simplified version of LaGrange 
formula for interpolating polynomials:</P>

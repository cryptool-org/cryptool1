<h3>Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol</h3>

		<P>The Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol was developed by Whitfield Diffie, 
			Martin E. Hellman and Ralph Merkle in 1976.</P>
		<P>CrypTool contains a visualization of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. 
			You can access it via the menu item <A href="menu_related_methods.html"><B>Individual 
					Procedures</B></A> / <B>Diffie-Hellman Demonstration</B>. For the 
			dialog <A href="hidd_diffiehellmanvisualization.html">Diffie-Hellman 
				Visualization</A> online help is offered too.</P>
		<P>Furthermore CrypTool offers an <A href="diffie-hellman-beispiel.html"><B>exemplary 
					execution</B></A> of the key exchange protocol with small numbers in 
			order to ease your understanding.</P>
		<P>Despite communicating via a non-secure line, the protocol enables two or more 
			parties to negotiate on a secret key which is solely known to the participating 
			parties.
		</P>
		<P>For better comprehension the two participating parties will be described as 
			Alice and Bob. The following drawing is to give a quick overview of the 
			Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol:</P>
		<P><IMG SRC="images/dh_procedure.gif" ALT="dh_procedure.gif" BORDER="0"></P>
		<P>The secret and common key, often described as <I>session key</I>, depends on the 
			following parameters:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
				Public parameters (p and g)</LI>
			<LI>
				Secret of Alice</LI>
			<LI>
				Secret of Bob</LI>
			<LI>
				Shared key of Alice</LI>
			<LI>
				Shared key of Bob</LI>
		</UL>
		<P>The protocol is based on the discrete logarithm problem, that is making use of a 
			so-called <B>one-way-function</B> property: Whereas the computation of a 
			mathematical one-way-function is of low complexity, the inverse operation is 
			extremely hard to accomplish.</P>
		<P>The creation of the session key at the end of the protocol is based on such a 
			one-way-function: Even if a potential attacker has knowledge of the shared keys 
			of both Alice and Bob, it is hardly possible for him to compute the session 
			key; depending on the key length, it can easily turn out as impossible for the 
			attacker to calculate the session key.</P>
		<P>Increasing the prime module p directly affects the complexity to compute the 
			session key. Anyhow, the additional expenses to compute the exponential 
			function are bearable for Alice and Bob.</P>
		<P>Contrary to the situation of Alice and Bob, the attacker needs to compute the 
			discrete logarithm, which is the <U>inversion of the exponential function</U>. 
			This effort increases much more than the effort necessary for the two 
			communication partners.</P>
		<P>For this reason the safety of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol depends 
			essentially on the size of the prime module p. In practical prime module 
			numbers are considered safe if their bit length has at least 1024 bit, which 
			complies with a 300-digit decimal number.</P>
		<P>Besides the prime module p, the secret numbers of Alice and Bob need to be of a 
			certain length in order to prevent the attacker from correctly guessing the 
			session key by chance. Thus, in practice secrets should be at least 80 bit long 
			(25-digit decimal number).</P>
		<P><B>Remark 1</B>:</P>
		<P>The key exchange protocol according to Diffie-Hellman is <B>NOT an encryption method</B>, 
			it is merely used to agree on a secret and common key.</P>
		<P><B>Remark 2</B>:</P>
		<P>The Diffie-Hellman protocol is vulnerable against "<a href="man_in_the_middle.html">Man-In-The-Middle</a>" 
			attacks:</P>
		<P>The attacker attempts to personate as Alice for Bob and at the same time to 
			personate as Bob against Alice (the attacker stands in the middle of the 
			communication between Alice and Bob). If he is successful then he obtains via 
			the Diffie-Hellman protocol a common secret key with Alice and a second common 
			secret key with Bob.</P>
		<P>This attack can be prevented via digital certificates by the secure 
			identification of the communication partners.</P>

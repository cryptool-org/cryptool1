		<h3>Dialog Factorization of a Number</h3>
		<P>This dialog can be called via <A href="menu_related_methods.html">Individual

				Factorization of a number</a>.</P>
		<P>The procedure for splitting up natural numbers into their prime factors is 
			referred to as <B>prime factorization</B>. Every natural number (which is 
			bigger than 1) can be broken down uniquely into its prime factors (apart from 
			the sequence of prime number factors).
		</P>
		<P>The factorization problem constitutes an important interface between 
			mathematics, information science and technology, because this theoretical 
			problem is also relevant to cryptography, as in the <B>Rabin-Williams algorithm</B> and <A href="hid_crypt_rsaenc.html">
					RSA algorithms</A>.</P>
		<P>This tutorial is intended to give you an idea of how factorization problems are 
			tackled in practice.</P>
		<P><IMG SRC="images/faktorisierungsalgorithmen.gif" ALT="faktorisierungsalgorithmen.gif"

		<P>You have various factorization algorithms to choose from to break down your 
			input.</P>
		<P>If you press the <B>Continue</B> button, the system attempts to split the input 
			into two factors using the selected algorithms. When the factorization results 
			are displayed, the two factors are shown in red.</P>
		<P>In this dialog efficient factorization algorithms are implemented.
		</P>
		<P>We recommend that you start off using the <B>Brute-force</B> and <B>Brent</B> algorithms, 
			as these methods discover relatively small factors very quickly. If you want to 
			factorise the number 10^40-1, it is sufficient to use the Brute-force and Brent 
			algorithms, as this input possesses only "small" prime factors.</P>
		<P>Example: 10^40-1</P>
		<P>Using the Brute-force method,</P>
		<P><IMG SRC="images/bruteforce.gif" ALT="bruteforce.gif" BORDER="0"></P>
		<P>and then the Brent method</P>
		<P><IMG SRC="images/brent.gif" ALT="brent.gif" BORDER="0"></P>
		<P>The algorithms <B>Pollard (p-1)</B> and <B>Williams (p+1)</B> are 
			likely to be successful if the number N to be factorised has a prime number p 
			such that (p-1) and (p+1) consists of only small prime factors. They are used 
			to split off factors that are relatively small and therefore naturally come 
			before the stronger factorization methods.</P>
		<P>Example: 233333330996666690033333333</P>
		<P><IMG SRC="images/pollard.gif" ALT="pollard.gif" BORDER="0"></P>
		<P>The <B>Lenstra</B> algorithm is based on a generalization of the Pollard (p-1) 
			method to elliptic curves. This method is also known as the <B>ECM (Elliptic Curve 
				Method)</B>. With ECM it is possible to break down far bigger factors. 
			Nevertheless, ECM is also suitable for drawing out factors with particular 
			characteristics. This limitation means that "relatively small" factors are more 
			likely to be found than "big" factors. Nevertheless, it is essentially more 
			worthwhile to use ECM instead of the Pollard (p-1) method.
		</P>
		<P>Example: 3035124991756191792335802070931</P>
		<P><IMG SRC="images/lenstraecm.gif" ALT="lenstraecm.gif" BORDER="0"></P>
		<P>Very small prime divisors p of a number n are discovered more quickly by trial 
			and error than using ECM. The time it takes to perform the ECM calculations 
			depends primarily on the size of the prime divisor that is being sought rather 
			than on the number that is to be factorised. If a number with 1000 decimal 
			places has a 20-digit divisor, then it can be found using ECM. On the other 
			hand, the bigger the smallest factor is, the greater the computing time. ECM is 
			suitable for factors with up to 30 decimal places. The biggest prime factor 
			found using this method up to now has 47 decimal places and was discovered by 
			Peter Montgomery of the Centre for Mathematics and Information Science (CWI) in 
			Amsterdam.</P>
		<P>The <B>quadratic sieve</B> is suitable for factorising numbers which are 
			composed out of more than one large factor (more than 30 decimal places).</P>
		<P>Example: 1999999999999999999077757777777777777777787</P>
		<P><IMG SRC="images/qsieb.gif" ALT="qsieb.gif" BORDER="0"></P>
		<P>The computing time here is not dependent on the smallest factor but on the 
			number to be factorised itself. The quadratic sieve is, albeit with slight 
			deviations, one of the fastest factorization methods yet been discovered by 
			mathematicians.</P>
		<P>Although apparently numbers up to 139 decimal places can be factorised using 
			this method, even this method contains too many places in which one has to 
			guess and search. And this guessing and searching (or giving up on guessing in 
			favor of searching) simply lasts too long to be an efficient factorization 
			method.</P>
		<P>The quadratic sieve was for many years considered the fastest factorization 
			method until a few years ago the <B>Number Field Sieve (NFS) </B>was 
			discovered. NFS, like the quadratic sieve, is a method for factorising large 
			numbers. NFS is potentially up to ten times faster than the Quadratic Sieve. 
			However, the algorithms implemented yet cannot fully utilise this potential 
			speed advantage. It is expected that over the next few years further 
			optimization will take place.</P>
		<P><B>The factorization of RSA-155</B></P>
		<P>On 22 Aug 1999, a research group co-ordinated by Herman te Riele of the CWI 
			Amsterdam, published the factorization of the 512-bit number <B>RSA-155</B> with 
			the NFS algorithm. RSA-155 comes from the "RSA challenge list" produced by RSA 
			inc.

		Application of the <B>sieve step</B> took 35.7 CPU years. The following

		<P>120 * 300-450 MHz Pentium II PCs</P>
		<P>4 * 500 MHz Digital/Compaq boxes</P>

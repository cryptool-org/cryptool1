<P><A NAME="menu_zeittafel"></A><B>Time-table / time-travel through cryptography</B></P>

<P>This <B>overview</B> of the various <B>cryptographic algorithms</B> is a chronological history of cryptology, whose origins date back to the days of antiquity and which over time has undergone steady refinement of its methods. Please note that this table is by no means complete.</P>

<P>The first human writing dates back more than 6000 years. Encryption has been in existence for around 3000 years.</P>

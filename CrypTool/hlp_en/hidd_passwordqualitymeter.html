<h3>Dialog Password Quality Meter</h3>

<P>You can access this dialog using the menu entry <a href="menu_related_methods.html">Individual 
Procedures</a> \ <a href="menu_relatedmethods_tools.html">Tools</a> \ 
<a href="hid_passwordqualitymeter.html">Password Quality Meter</a>.</P>

<P>It is impossible to exactly determine the security of a password, because too many factors play a 
role. This dialog contains different password quality meters helping you to estimate the security of 
your passwords.</P>

<P>For comprehensive information on passwords click <a href="passwords.html">here</a>.</P>

<h4><u>Usage of the dialog</u></h4>

<P>Please enter your password in the given input field to determine the 
<a href="#passwordquality">password quality</a>. The password quality is automatically updated with 
each key stroke.</P>

<P>The quality estimation of your password is based on four different algorithms. These algorithms 
come from the applications KeePass, Mozilla and PGP, which all have a password quality meter integrated. 
The fourth approach, which incorporates the resistance of passwords against dictionary attacks, was 
developed by the CrypTool team.</P>

<P>Besides the percental display in the lower part of the dialog there is a colored smiley. It 
displays the password quality in five categories ranging from poor (<B>red</B>) over weak 
(<B>orange</B>), average (<B>yellow</B>) and good (<B>green</B>) to great (<B>light green</B>). Please 
note that the graphical display only refers to the average result of KeePass, Mozilla, PGP and 
CrypTool.</P>

<P>Below the password input field you can select whether you want to enter the password in the 
clear or have it hidden with place holders (*).</P>

<h4><u><a name="passwordquality"></a>Password quality</u></h4>

<P>The term <B>password quality</B> is <B>a measure for the security of your password</B>.</P>

<P>In the context of most programs offering password quality measurement, the password quality is 
based on the password entropy. This approach is used by KeePass and 
PGP for example.</P>

<P>Besides, there are different approaches like the one integrated in the Mozilla browser. Here the 
letters of the alphabet are grouped and evaluated apart (i.e. special characters and lowercase 
letters). </P>

<P>Normally, password quality is shown in percent. The scaling depends on the measurement approach: 
For entropy-based password quality measurement a password entropy of 128 bit is assumed to equal a 
password quality of 100%. But there are different approaches for quality scaling depending on the 
quality measurement approach used.</P>

<P>The two following examples will show how the different approaches to password quality measurement 
affect the result:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The password <B>a-a-a</B> results in a much higher quality with Mozilla than with PGP (60% and 16%). 
The result of PGP sounds plausible because the password is very short. The result of Mozilla seems too 
high. The reason for this is the following: With five characters the password possesses the required 
minimum length without getting a penalty for shortness. With the two additional special characters the 
password quality increases further to the aforementioned 60%.</LI>
<LI>The password <B>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</B> results in a much lower quality rating with Mozilla 
than with PGP (30% and 100%). The result of Mozilla sounds plausible. Although the password is very 
long it can be guessed quite easily. PGP, on the other hand, seems to consider only the length of the 
password.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B><U>Remark</U></B>:</P>

<P>Not all entropy-based password quality meters (i.e. KeePass, PGP) use the same technique to determine 
the password entropy. Therefore, the calculated entropy values may vary.</P>

<h4><u><a name="passwordresistance"></a>Resistance against dictionary attacks</u></h4>

<P>Besides the password quality estimation, it is estimated how resistant the password is against 
dictionary attacks. Therefore, the password is searched for patterns (i.e. "aaaaa"), sequences (i.e. 
"abcdef"), keyboard sequences (i.e. "qwerty") and dictionary words.</P>

<P>Moreover, the password is judged by certain password guidelines. These guidelines can be freely 
configured in the dialog <a href="hidd_password_guidelines.html">Password Guidelines</a> after clicking 
the <B>Password guidelines</B> button.</P>

<P><B>Remark</B>:</P>

<P>A high password quality doesn't necessarily mean that you picked a good password!</P>

<h3>Dialog Password Quality Meter</h3>

<P>You can access this dialog using the menu entry <a href="menu_related_methods.html">Individual Procedures</a> \ <a href="menu_relatedmethods_tools.html">Tools</a> \ <a href="hid_passwordqualitymeter.html">Password Quality Meter</a>.</P>

<P>It is impossible in practice to exactly determine the security of a password, because too many factors play a role. This dialog contains different password quality meters helping you to estimate the security of your passwords.</P>


<h4><u>Usage of the dialog</u></h4>

<P>Please enter your password in the given input field to determine the <a href="#passwordquality">password quality</a>. The password quality is automatically updated with each key stroke.</P>

<P>The quality estimation of your password is based on four different algorithms. Three of those algorithms come from the applications KeePass, Mozilla and PGP, which all have a password quality meter integrated. The fourth approach is an experimental approach of the CrypTool team.</P>

<P>Besides the percental display in the lower part of the dialog there is a coloured smiley. It displays the password quality in five categories ranging from poor (<B>red</B>) over weak (<B>orange</B>), average (<B>yellow</B>) and good (<B>green</B>) to great (<B>light green</B>). Please note that the graphical display only refers to the result of the experimental approach.</P>

<P>Below the password input field you can select whether you want to enter the password in the clear or have it hidden with place holders (*).</P>


<h4><u><a name="passwordquality"></a>Password quality</u></h4>

<P>The term <B>password quality</B> is <B>a degree for the security of your password</B>.</P>

<P>In the context of most programs offering password quality measurement, the password quality is often based on the password entropy. This is the most widespread approach for password quality measurement, and it is used by KeePass and PGP for example.</P>

<P>Besides there are different approaches like the one integrated in the Mozilla browser.</P>

<P>Normally, password quality is shown in percent. The scaling depends on the measurement approach: For entropy-based password quality measurement a password entropy of 128 bit is assumed to equal a password quality of 100%. But there are different approaches for quality scaling depending on the quality measurement approach used.</P>


<h4><u>Password length, password space and password entropy</u></h4>

<P>If you take inappropriate handling and storage of passwords out of the equation, then the security of a password depends on the length of the password, the size of the password space and the entropy of the password.</P>

<P>The length of a password has a huge influence on its security. Short passwords can easily be guessed, so in turn a short password is a bad password. The longer a password, the better.</P>

<P>The size of the password space is the amount of passwords that can be created with all available characters (the alphabet). Assume you have an alphabet of 52 letters (upper- and lowercase) as well as ten digits, then the password space consists of 62^8, that is around 200 trillion passwords. If you increase the size of the alphabet with 10 more characters (for example special characters), the password space grows to more than three times of its size. The bigger the password space, the better.</P>

<P>The password entropy indicates how randomly a password is chosen out of the given password space. In an ideal world you should go for maximum entropy, which means that all passwords in the password space have equal probability of being chosen. You can exactly determine the entropy of a password, but in order to do this certain assumptions have to be made in advance.</P>


<P><B>Remark</B>:</P>

<P>A high password quality doesn't necessarily mean that you picked a good password! For example there is no dictionary checking implemented yet (words out of dictionaries are considered to be bad passwords in general). The CrypTool team plans to solve this problem with its exeperimental password quality measurement approach.</P>

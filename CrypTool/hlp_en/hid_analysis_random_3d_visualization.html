<h3>3D Visualization (Menu <A href="menu_analyze.html">Analysis</A> \ Analyze Randomness)</h3>

<P><B><U>General Information</U></B></P>

<p>
Random numbers are used extensively in cryptography, e. g. for generation
of key material. It is among the more difficult tasks of a cryptographer
to determine the quality of a random number source - statistically good
random numbers are not necessarily cryptographically secure as well.
If an adversary is able to exploit a structure within the stream of random
numbers in order to deduce future values with a certain probability, the
cryptographic keys generated from these random numbers are vulnerable to
attack - even if the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.
</p>
<p>
In order to measure the quality of random numbers various tests and criteria
have been established that usually analyze the random number sequences
numerically. Some of them have also been implemented in CrypTool.
</p>
<p>
In addition to numerical approaches, structures in random number sequences
can also be visualized graphically. CrypTool implements an algorithm that
is called <b>phase space visualization</b> which was first implemented by Dan
Kaminsky of <a href="http://www.doxpara.com/" target="_blank">DoxPara</a> in his
program <em>Phentropy</em> (Part of the 
<a href="http://www.doxpara.com/read.php/code/paketto.html" target="_blank">
Paketto Keiretsu</a> Toolkit).
</p>

<P><B><U>Visualization Usage</U></B></P>

<p>
Random number 3D analysis always applies to the CrypTool windows that
was active during invocation of 3D visualization. Once all input data
has been processed as described below, the resulting 3D cube is rendered
in a CrypTool window. The cube can be manipulated freely by 
<ul>
  <li>dragging it with the mouse (left mouse button plus drag),</li>
  <li>scaling it (shift, right button plus drag) and</li>
  <li>panning it (right mouse button plus drag).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Right click in the render window opens a pop-up-window, where you can change the display preference.
</p>
<p>
1. <em>Box</em> toggles the cube's bounding box. 
</p>
<p>
2. The <em>Preferences</em> menu allows to modify the display options that
are applied to the render window after closing the preference window:
<dl>
  <dt><b>Resolution</b></dt>
  <dd>Determines the <em>logical resolution</em> of the rendered cube.
    The default value of 128 represents a logical resolution of 128 * 128 * 128
    pixels in the cube. Higher resolutions yield a more detailed view of
    the rendered data, but also demand more memory and CPU power. Reduce
    this value if your computer cannot generate a smooth animation.<br/>
    The computed X-, Y- and Z-coordinates in the phase space are scaled
    to match the logical resolution set here. This means that usually
    a number of coordinates in the phase space are projected into one single
    logical pixel.<br/>
    The <em>physical resolution</em> of the cube is solely dependent on
    the window size that can be changed by dragging the window border.
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Density</b></dt>
  <dd>The displayed density influences brightness of the pixels set in
    the rendered cube. Once a coordinate has been determined the brightness
    of this particular pixel is increased by the density value.
    Once the maximum brightness of 255 is reached the brightness is
    sustained.
    A low density value results in darker but also more detailed 
    visualization.<br/>
    When using a densitiy of 127 half the total brightness of a pixel
    is reached on first occurrence of this coordinate. The (almost)
    maximum brightness of 254 will already be achieved on the second
    occurrence of this coordinate.
  </dd>
  </dt>
  <dt><b>Shift</b></dt>
  <dd>
    All coordinates are subject to a shift operation (relative to the 
    logical resolution) before rendering. For a shift value of 50 % this
    means that the coordinate origin ends up centered in the rendered
    cube.
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Word size</b></dt>
  <dd>
    The input sequence can be interpreted as a stream of words of 1, 2 or
    4 byte length. The word size is completely arbitrary as seen from the
    analysis perspective, but it influences the results of phase space
    analysis and its visualization. The correct choice for a distinct
    input file depends on the type of data contained therein:
    Audio data (e. g. in WAV format) uses a 2 byte word size, executable
    data of 32 bit processors has a word size of 4 byte.
  </dd>
</dl>
</p>
<h2>Phase space visualization</h2>
<p>
Phase space visualization in CrypTool works as follows:<br/>
</p>
<h3>Coordinate computation</h3>
<p>
Within the word sequence the difference between two adjacent words is
computed and interpreted as a coordinate in 3D space:
</p>
<img src="images/phasespace1.gif"/>
<p>
In this example the word length is 1, hence the difference between individual
adjacent bytes of the input sequence is computed directly.
The difference computation is done modulo the word co-domain, i. e. 256
for word size 1, 65.536 for word size 2 and 4.294.967.296 for word size 4.
</p>
<p>
Three adjacent difference values are now interpreted as X-, Y- and 
Z-coordinates within a cube of the word size's co-domain dimension.
Once a pixel in 3D space has been determined, the brightness value
of this pixel is increased by a fixed value that is called <em>density</em>.
For this example the two coordinates P1 = (128, 40, 244) and 
P2 = (237, 209, 121) are calculated.
</p>
<p>
If a word size of e. g. 2 is used, the general procedure remains the same.
The only difference is that adjacent bytes in the input sequence are interpreted
as a word in 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_endian">Little-Endian format</a>
that is used for the usual difference calculation:
</p>
<img src="images/phasespace2.gif"/>
<p>
The resulting pixel has the coordinates (7080, 48609, 62001).
</p>
<h3>Interpretation of rendering results</h3>
<p>
Phase space visualization is capable of showing structure in data sequences.
A stream of true random data generates a uniform fog-like filling of the 
rendered cube:
</p>
<img src="images/3dvis1.png"/>
<p>
If dots, clusters, lines or planes can be made out this is an indication
for an inner structure of the input data.
</p>
<p>
Particularly interesting is the analysis of non-random data types, such
as executable programs, office documents, PDF files, pictures, audio
or text files. In most data formats characteristic patterns can be
recognized. The following screenshot shows the phase space of a CrypTool 
executable in which planes and lines can be seen:
</p>
<img src="images/3dvis2.png"/>
<p>
If a document contains many similar values (e. g. null bytes in program
data), a high number of computed differences is close to zero, resulting
in a corresponding 3D coordinate that is close to its origin. Without
shifting the origin this would result in a cumulation in the cube's corners.
Due to this observation in most cases it is advisable to shift the computed
coordinates 50 % within the cube: clusters around the origin hence move
to the center of the cube and often form geometric patterns which can be
made out much easier this way.
</p>
<h3>Limitations of phase space analysis</h3>
<p>
If structures can be recognized within a phase space visualization,
it is certain that no true random numbers are the source of the analysis.
However this is not true vice-versa: Uniform fog-like filling of the cube
cannot be taken as an indication for cryptographic secure random numbers!
</p>
<h3>Rendering engine</h3>
<p>
In order to display the phase space analysis to the user CrypTool utilizes
a slightly modified variant of the OpenGL based 3D rendering engine
<em>VolRen</em> contained in the 
<a href="http://openqvis.sourceforge.net">OpenQVis project</a>.

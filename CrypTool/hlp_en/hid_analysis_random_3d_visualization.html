<h3>Random number visualization (Menu <A href="menu_analyze.html">Analysis</A> \ Analyse Randomness)</h3>

<p>
Random numbers are used extensively in cryptography, e. g. for generation
of key material. It is among the more difficult tasks of a cryptographer
to determine the quality of a random number source - statistically good
random numbers are not necessarily cryptographically secure as well.
If an adversary is able to exploit a structure within the stream of random
numbers in order to deduce future values with a certain probability, the
cryptographic keys generated from these random numbers are vulnerable to
attack - even if the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.
</p>
<p>
In order to measure the quality of random numbers various tests and criteria
have been established that usually analyze the random number sequences
numerically. Some of them have also been implemented in CrypTool.
</p>
<p>
In addition to numerical approaches, structures in random number sequences
can also be visualized graphically. CrypTool implements an algorithm that
is called <b>phase space visualization</b> which was first implemented by Dan
Kaminsky of <a href="http://www.doxpara.com/" target="_new">DoxPara</a> in his
program <em>Phentropy</em> (Part of the 
<a href="http://www.doxpara.com/read.php/code/paketto.html" target="_new">
Paketto Keiretsu</a> Toolkit).

<H3>Dialog Solitaire analysis</H3>

<IMG SRC="images/solitaireanalysisdialog.png" BORDER=0>

<p>This dialog provides a cryptanalysis 
(<a href="HID_ANALYSE_SYMCLASSIC_CIPHERTEXTONLY_SOLITAIRE.html">Solitaire analysis</a>) of a 
<A href="chiffretext.html">ciphertext</a>, which is encrypted with the <a href="HID_SYMCLASSIC_SOLITAIRE.html">Solitaire algorithm</a>. The ciphertext has to be loaded as a text document. The text is bounded by 65,535 letters. The rest will be ignored. Then the <a href="kartendeck.html">initial deck</a> is generated by using the found final deck. With this initial deck the keystream will be generated and the <A href="chiffretext.html">ciphertext</a> can be decrypted.</p>

<p>Please follow the numbers of the frames (groupings) in this dialog (grouping 1 to 4).</p>


<p><b><u>Determining the initial deck</u></b></p>


<p><B>Grouping 1: Parameters of the found deck</B></P>

<P>Please choose the way of determining the found <a href="kartendeck.html">final deck</a>. For that click one of the buttons <B>Load final deck</B> or <B>Own choice</B>.</P>

<ul>
<li>Button <B>Load final deck</B>: You can load a final deck, which has been saved at the encryption.</li>

<li>Button <B>Own choice</B>: You can create a new final deck in the grouping "Own choice". Also the number of cards can be varied.</li>
</ul>

<p>The grouping <B>Own choice</B> becomes active, when you chose "Own choice" in grouping 1. First you have to choose the number of cards (<B>3 to 54</B>). 54 is set as the default value. Then you construct your prefered final deck through clicking the buttons <B>1 to 54</B> in your wished order. If you make a mistake, please click the <B>Reset</B> button and enter your input again. While you are clicking the buttons, you can see the current deck in the output field "Found deck" in grouping 3. When you reach the chosen number of cards, i.e you clicked all buttons, you get an according message.
</p>


<br><p><B>Grouping 2: Positioning the joker</B></p>

<P>Because of the irreversibility of the Solitaire algorithm in some special cases it has to be decided, whether to place joker A or joker B at the top or at the bottom of the card deck, when trying to find the initial deck. This grouping allows to choose between <B>Always to front</B>, <B>Always to back</B>, and <B>Start manual</B>.</P>

<ul>
<li><B>Always to front</B>: If a special case appears, the joker is always placed to the front of the card deck.</li>
<li><B>Always to back</B>: If a special case appears, the joker is always placed to the back of the card deck.</li>
<li><B>Start manual</B>: If a special case appears, the user has to decide where to place the joker. With the button <B>Cancel</B> in the message box you can leave the procedure.</li>
</ul>

<P>The manual cryptanalysis as well as the automatical (using always the same decision) cryptanalysis can take wrong decisions, with the result of a wrong plaintext.</P>


<br><p><B>Grouping 3: Generating the initial deck</B></p>

<P>This grouping provides three different card decks:</P>
<ul>
<li><B>Found deck</B>: Represents the found card deck, which is either loaded or created by the user. It should be a valid final deck created when performing an earlier encryption with Solitaire.</li>
<li><B>Temporary deck</B>: Represents the different modifications of the card deck during the 
cryptanalysis.</li>
<li><B>Initial deck</B>: If the cryptanalysis is successful, the same initial deck as the one, which has been used for generating the keystream at the encryption, is shown here.</li>
</ul>


<br><p><B>Grouping 4: Generating the keystream</B></p>

<P>By using the created <a href="kartendeck.html">initial deck</a> the Solitaire algorithm can be started by clicking the button <B>Automatic generating of the keystream</B>. So the keystream is generated and it is possible to decrypt the ciphertext using this keystream.</p>

<p>The keystream contains as many numbers as there are characters in the window of the lastly opened document in CT1. By clicking the button <B>Decrypt</B> the ciphertext can be decrypted at once (but only if the created initial deck is the same one as the initial deck, which was used for the encryption). The found "plaintext" will be shown in a newly created window in the CT1 main window.</p>

<br><p>With the <B>Cancel</B> button you can leave the dialog at any time.</p><br>

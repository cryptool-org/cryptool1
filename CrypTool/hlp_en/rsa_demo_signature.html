<h3>Digital signing of messages</h3>

<OL type="a">

<LI><B>Simple, naive procedure</B>: you could encrypt a plaintext using secret key (N,d). The situation has now fundamentally altered:</LI>

<div class="indent">

<P><B>Anyone can decrypt the encrypted message using public key (N,e). But only you, as owner of the secret key (N,d), could encrypt the message.</B></P>

</div>

<P>The owner of the secret key encrypts message M using the secret key C(N,d;M). The encrypted version C(N,d;M) can also be viewed as the <B>signature</B> for message M, because the authenticity of the signature can be verified by anyone in possession of C(N,d;M), public key (N,e) and message M:</P>

<div class="indent">

<P><B>The signature C(N,d;M) is valid if the signature that was decrypted with (N,e), M‚ = E(N,e;C), matches the message M.</B></P>

</div>

<LI> In practice usually not the message itself is signed, but it is condensed into a hash value of fixed length using a <A href="hashfunktion.html">hash function</A> Hand then the hash value signed. This eliminates the following disadvantages of the pure signature C(N,d;M):</LI>

<div class="indent">

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>If a message M is encrypted with the secret RSA key, the amount of time needed for long messages M is very high. </LI>

	<LI>The signature C(N,d;M) is at least as long as the signed message M itself.</LI>

	<LI>A possible privacy problem, because the message can be recovered from the signature.</LI>
</UL>

</div>

<P>Therefore it is more efficient to sign only the hash value H = H(M) of the message. To verify the signature C = C(N,d;H), one now requires knowledge of the hash function H that has been used as well: </P>

<div class="indent">

<P><B>The signature C(N,d;H) is valid if the signature that was decrypted with (N,e), H‚ = E(N,e;C), matches the message M‚s hash value H(M).</B></P>

</div>

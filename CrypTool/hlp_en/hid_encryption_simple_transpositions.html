<h3>Simple Transpositions (Menu <A href="menu_crypt.html">Crypt/Decrypt</A> \ Symmetric (classic))</h3>

<P>Transposition ciphers scramble the order of the letters in the clear text.</P>

<P>Two simple transpositions are the Rail-Fence encryption and the Scytale.</P>

<P>1) The Rail-Fence encryption writes the letters of the clear text alternately in two or 
more rows. One can retrieve the encrypted message by reading out the letters row by row.</P>

<!--

-->

<P>The receiver can decrypt the message by simply inverting the procedure. In order to do that, 
the receiver needs to know over how many rows the message was spread.</P>

<P>Variations thereof are for example</P>

<UL>
<LI>an additional offset (that means the first letter of the clear text is not written in the 
first, but in the third row for example, and from there the procedure continues as usual). In 
this case, the offset is part of the key.</LI>
<LI>Pairs of letters are transformed instead of single letters. This is very weak.</LI>
<LI>Also, you can create groups of letters of a fixed size and scramble the letters within 
these groups according to a certain pattern (permutation). If each of the groups consists of 
only one pair of letters, the first and the second letter switch places, the third and the 
fourth and so on. You can try this using the menu <a href="menu_crypt.html">Crypt/Decrypt</a> \ 
<a href="menu_crypt_symmetricclassic.html">Symmetric (classic)</a> \ 
<a href="HID_PERMUTATION_ASC.html">Permutation/Transposition</a>.</LI>

<P>2) The Scytale is a transposition cipher as well. It was the first military encryption 
algorithm, and it was used by the Spartans as early as the fifth century. The Scytale is a 
wooden stick wrapped by a strip of leather or parchment. The sender writes his message along the 
wooden stick and then unwraps the strip. After that the strip seems to contain only a pointless 
series of letters. Possibly, the strip was used by the messenger as a belt with the letters 
facing the inside. In order to recover the message, the receiver simply wrapped the strip around 
a Scytale of the same diameter as the Scytale of the sender. In 404 A.D., Lysander of Sparta 
ran into a dying messenger, one of only five who survived the strenuous march from Persia. The 
messenger gave Lysander his belt, and Lysander wrapped it around his Scytale. Thus he learned that 
Pharnabasus of Persia planned an attack against him. Thanks to the Scytale, Lysander could prepare 
for the attack and successfully defend it.</P>

<P>Therefore, the key is a Scytale with the correct diameter or the correct number of edges, 
respectively. If you can guess the procedure, the Scytale is a very insecure algorithm since 
the amount of possible keys is limited.</P>

<P>A variant thereof is to use an additional offset: Using an offset of 1, the wrapping of the 
clear text is not started on the first winding in the first row, but on the second winding. 
Consequently, the clear text does not start at the beginning of the belt. This offset is a 
part of the key, too.</P>

<h3><A name="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<P>The old method (now called method 2) for <B>automatic crypt analysis of monoalphabetic substitution ciphers</B> 
implemented in CrypTool was based on the recognition of the most frequent words of 
a language and had the following constraints: No automatic language recognition, the need for 
retaining whitespaces within the ciphertext and no distinction between upper and lower case.</P>

<P>The new implementation now called method 1 is based on "A Fast Method for the Cryptanalysis of Substitution 
Ciphers" (Cryptologia 19:3, 1995) by Thomas Jakobsen. Mainly this method was to introduce 
the following benefits:</P>

<UL>
<LI>better rates of success for decryption,</LI>
<LI>increase of speed,</LI>
<LI>decryption of ciphertexts with and without whitespaces.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The algorithm works on the Latin alphabet mit 26 characters (A to Z). The alphabet can 
be extended with the whitespace character, so that whitespaces are encrypted just like other 
characters (each character is mapped on another character). Umlauts, punctuation marks and 
special characters as well as upper and lower case are retained during encryption.</P>

<P>Furthermore the new implementation was extended with an algorithm for automatic language 
recognition. The implemented method is based on the "index of coincidence" (according to 
W. F. Friedman, 1922).</P>

<h3><A name="implementation">Implementation</h3>

<h4><A name="automaticanalysis">Automatic crypt analysis</h4>

<P>The implemented crypt analysis method determines the frequency distribution of the 
given text. The frequency distribution of single characters is used to compute the initial 
value of the key, whereas the frequency distribution of digrams is used to determine the 
quality of this key. The method is based on a fast algorithm, computing an initial value for 
the key at the beginning and then improving this key with each iteration.</P>

<P>The increased speed of this method is based on the following details: The initial value of 
the key is created with regard to the frequency distribution of single characters of the 
ciphertext. Then a distribution matrix for digrams is used. During key search the frequency of single characters is taken into account.</P>

<P>The computation of the key "quality" is based on a comparison of the digram frequency 
distribution of the given ciphertext with the frequency distribution of the CrypTool 
reference text file, which can be found via the menu entry <A href="menu_options.html">Options</A> 
\ <A href="hid_opttext.html">Text Options</A>. The overall deviation is computed by summing 
up the deviation of all single digrams. The smaller this deviation is, the "better" is the 
computed key. In an ideal case there should be no deviation at all. But this is rarely seen 
in reality, since every text has its own digram frequency distribution differing from the 
reference distribution. So the strategy of this algorithm is the minimization of the given 
deviation.</P>

<P>According to the author Thomas Jakobsen, this method is significantly faster than other known methods 
such as Carroll-Robbins and King-Bahler, and the algorithm is to succeed at a rate of 98% 
(with ciphertexts of at least 400 characters).</P>

<h4><A name="languagerecognition">Language recognition</h4>

<P>It is easier to decide which language a ciphertext was written in than it is to 
decrypt this ciphertext without knowing the key. This has already been shown by W. F. 
Friedman in 1922. The language is determined using the index of coincidence, which is 
characteristic for a certain language. The index of coincidence is computed using the 
frequency of single characters in the ciphertext.</P>

<P>But even language recognition does not always lead to accurate results. The reason for 
this is the statistical spread of character frequencies in different texts that 
significantly differ from reference texts of a certain language.</P>

<h3><A name="usage">Usage</h3>

<P>The automatic crypt analysis is started via the menu entry 
<A href="menu_analyze.html">Analysis</A> \ Symmetric Encryption (classic) \ 
Ciphertext only \ Substitution.</P>

<P>After that the user can choose between the old and the new algorithm:</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/automaticAnalysisSubstitutionSelection.gif" ALT="images/automaticAnalysisSubstitutionSelection.gif" BORDER=0></P>

<P>By default the new algorithm (digram analysis) is selected. After choosing the algorithm,
an options dialog is shown as follows:</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/automaticAnalysisSubstitutionOptions.gif" ALT="images/automaticAnalysisSubstitutionOptions.gif" BORDER=0></P>

<P>Users can choose if whitespaces belong to the alphabet. Additionally the user can hide 
the graphical user interface during analysis in order to see the finals result only. The 
selection of this option leads to an increase of speed, because the text does not need to 
be decrypted and printed on the screen after each successful iteration.</P>

<P>The following warning appears if the text to be analyzed is too short (less than 
300 characters of the alphabet):</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/automaticAnalysisSubstitutionWarning.gif" ALT="images/automaticAnalysisSubstitutionWarning.gif" BORDER=0></P>

<P>The final result is shown in another window. If the graphical user interface was not 
deactivated earlier, the current computations are shown in the same window. The display is 
updated each time a "better" key was found, so the crypt analysis can be tracked in a 
dynamic way.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/automaticAnalysisSubstitutionResult.gif" ALT="images/automaticAnalysisSubstitutionResult.gif" BORDER=0></P>

<P>The user can copy the current 
substitution key to the internal key store by clicking the button "Copy key". Furthermore the user 
can try to improve the result of the automatic analysis by clicking the button "Manual analysis".</P>

<p>If the user accepts the substitution, a new window is opened containing the 
decrypted text. The text can then be saved by the user. </p>

<h3><A name="constraints">Known constraints</h3>

<P>The biggest constraint to the aforementioned methods is the length of the ciphertext. Like with all other frequency based methods, the ciphertext has to be sufficient in 
size to allow the substitution analysis at all. Thus the implemented methods are not suited
for the crypt analysis of short ciphertexts. According to the author, best results are 
achieved when using ciphertexts of 300 to 400 characters or more (98% rate of success), 
whereas the rate of success for ciphertexts of 100 to 200 characters is between 50% and 80%.</P>

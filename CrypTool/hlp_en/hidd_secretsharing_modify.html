<h3>Dialog Secret Sharing Demonstration: Modifying polynomial parameters</h3>

<P>If a polynomial has already been created and maybe even the participants' shares were computed, there is still the possibility of modifying this part of the scheme.</P>
<P>Based on the secret S, threshold t and number of participants n you can call a dialogue by clicking the button "Edit polynomial parameters" of the <A href="hidd_secretsharing_setup.html">setup dialogue</A> at any point of time.</P>
<P><IMG alt=SS_Modify.gif src="images/SS_Modify.gif" border=0></P>
<P>At the top of the dialogue all the unchangeable parameters are displayed. Below are two separate boxes. One shows your current prime p, one shows the coefficients of the polynomial, separated by commas.</P>
<P>There are two options of modifying parameters. On the one hand, a new prime can be created randomly by choosing the button "Generate polynomial". All coefficients are customized as well. On the other hand, you can manually modify parameters. Modifications are accepted by left-clicking the OK-Button. Of course, manual changes are checked before they are adopted. If any of the values does not match Shamirs criteria, CrypTool will alert you.</P>

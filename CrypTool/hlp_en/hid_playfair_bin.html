<h3>Playfair (Menu <A href="menu_crypt.html">Encrypt/Decrypt</A> \ Symmetric (classic))</h3>

<P>The Playfair <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="verschluesselung.html">encryption algorithm</A> is based on an algorithm developed by Charles Wheatstone in 1854.
The following example shows how Playfair operates:</P>

<P>To start with, one requires an encryption key (as an example we will use the
word "PEGASOS"). This password is entered in a 5x5 or 6x6 matrix using the
<A href="hidd_key_playfair.html">Playfair key entry</A> dialog, as illustrated
below.</P>

<P>The remaining cells in the matrix are then filled in with the alphabetic
letters that are left over. Any characters which already exist are omitted
here.</P>

<P>The Playfair alphabet consists of 26 letters (A to Z). In a 5x5 matrix,
the J is left out. In a 6x6 matrix, the original alphabet is extended with
digits (0 to 9).</P>

<div class="indent">
<P><IMG SRC="images/playfairkeydialog.png" ALT="playfairkeydialog.png" BORDER="0"></P>
</div>
		
<P>First, the message to be encrypted is pre-formatted: The lower-case
letters are converted to capital letters and non-alphabet characters
are removed.</P>
		
<P>Then, the result is written down in blocks of two characters each (digrams).
For example, suppose the message to be encrypted is:</P>

<div class="indent">
<P>AL LE SI ST HE RA US FL IE HE SO FO RT  (= " cover is broken flee immediately ").</P>
</div>

<P>To encrypt the message, first of all one takes the first pair of letters, AL. These two letters form the 
end points of one of the diagonals in a rectangle (A-L from bottom to top). The endpoints of the other 
diagonal (also read from bottom to top) are points P and M. The pair of letters AL is thus replaced by the 
pair PM. LE becomes XR. There are problems with the pair ST as both letters occur in the same row. In this 
case the letters immediately to the right of the original letters are used - TW. If there are no more letters 
to the left, then one simply proceeds to the end of the row. If the letters in a letter pair in the table are 
above each other, as is the case with the pair FL, then in each case one takes the next letters underneath - 
LY. The encrypted message now reads:</P>

<div class="indent">
<P>M XR TH TW KB UP BA LY KC KB TP KP CP</P>
</div>

<P>To improve security, it is possible to eliminate any letter duplications prior to encryption by 
inserting, for example, the letter X, as pairs of identical letters provide attackers with a lot of useful 
information.</P>

<P>Because letter pairs are used, the algorithm is more difficult to break than cryptosystems which only use 
individual letters. Thus, for example, a frequency analysis is less informative and the creation of code 
books is more long-winded. For this reason modern methods do not limit themselves to just two characters, 
but IDEA, for example, operates with 64-bit (i.e. 8-character) blocks.</P>

<P>A detailed <A href="szenarien_playfair.html">example</A> of the Playfair encryption algorithm will be 
found in the <A href="hid_hilfe_szenarien.html">Examples</A> chapter.</P>

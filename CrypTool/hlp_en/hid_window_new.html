<h3><P><A NAME="hid_window_new"></A><B>The <U>New Window</U> menu option (Menu <A href="menu_window.html">Window</A>)</B></P></h3>

<P>This menu option is used to open a window which has the same content as the active window. You can open several document windows.  This allows you to view different parts or views of a <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="dokument.html">document</A> simultaneously. If you change the content in one of the open windows, the changes are adopted by all the windows which contain the same document. If you open a new window, this becomes the active window and is superimposed over all the other open windows. </P>

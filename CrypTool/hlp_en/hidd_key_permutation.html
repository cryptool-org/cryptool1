<h3>Dialog Key Entry: Permutation / Transposition</h3>

<P>You can reach this dialog via the menu entry <A href="menu_crypt.html">Encrypt/Decrypt</A> \ <a href="menu_crypt_symmetricclassic.html">Symmetric (classic)</a> \ <a href="hid_permutation.html">Permutation/Transposition</a>.</P>

<P>This dialog is used to enter the permutations for <A href="hid_permutation.html">Encryption by permutation</A>.</P>

<P>In each of the two input fields a keyword or a numerical permutation can be entered. The method for working out the relevant permutation is described under <A href="hid_permutation.html">Encryption by permutation</A>.</P>

<P>An entry in the first field is mandatory. An entry in the second input field is optional. If a second entry is made not one but two permutations are performed.</P>

<P>For each permutation it is possible to specify whether the data should be read in/out by row or column. Additionally it is possible to set the permutation to be a permutation of columns or a permutation of rows.</P>

<P>The maximum permutation length is 100. It can be entered either as 100 capital letters or as a number sequence that is a permutation of 1, 2, ..., 100.</P>

<P>By activating the checkbox within the group <B>Options</B> you can determine that before encryption or decryption the input permutations are inverted. Furthermore you can specify how the input data is processed: While all characters are processed in binary mode, text mode works differently: Depending on the current settings in the text options dialog (see button <B>Text Options</B>), characters which are not part of the current alphabet are either retained without change (and their positions are respected) or removed before the actual transposition.</P>

<P>You can get information on the <A href="hidd_key_permutation_info.html">Used permutation and its inverse</A> by clicking the Encrypt or Decrypt button.</P>

<P><STRONG>Remark 1:</STRONG></BR>
Historically the permutation exchanging columns twice was called <a href="hid_permutation.html">double column transposition</a>.</P>
<P><STRONG>Remark 2:</STRONG></BR>
The first historically know variant of this cipher was the <A href="hid_encryption_simple_transpositions.html">
Scytale of Sparta</A> (500 B.C.).</P>
<p><STRONG>Remark 3:</STRONG></BR>
For single step permutation a <a href="hid_known_analysis_single_permutation.html">known-plaintext analysis</a> is available.

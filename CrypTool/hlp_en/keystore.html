<h3>The Internal Key Store</h3>

<P>In CrypTool a clipboard-like internal key storage
is implemented which can save exactly one key for each encryption method.<br>
The keys in there are stored not persistently (within the
<a href="persistentsettings.html">registry</a>) but
only during the lifetime of a CrypTool session.</P>

<P>The internal key storage stores the key and the settings (parameters) which are
necessary for the particular cipher method (e.g. for Playfair not only the password
is stored but also the separators and who doublicate letters are handled, as these
configuration parameters are needed to be able to uniquely reverse the operation).<br>

Normally the alphabet is not stored (see text options).<br>
Exception: For the Hill cipher the internal key store considers
the alphabet and the text options used with this method as part of the
key, because the modul, an important parameter of the method, is created from the alphabet.
</P>

<P><B>a) How to display and store a key (from within a document)?</B><br>
	If you have encrypted a document, please click the icon
	<IMG alt="iconkeydialog.gif" src="images\IconKeyDialog.gif" border="0">
	"Show key". In the following dialog box please click the button <B>Copy key</B>. 
	Thus the desired key which was used to encrypt the document is stored for the 
	specific encryption method in the internal key store.</P>
	
<P><B>b) How to store a key (from within a dialog)?</B><br>
    In some dialogs you can copy the current key into the internal key store by clicking 
    the button <B>Copy key</B>. The functionality is the same as in copying a key from 
    within a document (see above).</P>
	
<P><B>c) How to retrieve a key?</B><br>
	If you want to decrypt or analyze an encrypted document, please click
	the icon <IMG alt="iconinsertkey.gif" src="images\IconInsertKey.gif" border="0">
	"Paste key". Thus the desired key is retrieved from the internal key store and 
	copied into the field for key entry. Note that you can only retrieve keys from 
	the internal key store if you stored a key before for the specific encryption method.</P>


<br>
<P><B>Remark 1: Persistency</B><br>
If you close CrypTool the contents of the key store is lost.</P>


<P><B>Remark 2: Text options</B><br>
The settings you make in the <A href="hidd_text_options.html">Text Options</A>
dialog are not stored in the internal key store.

<h3>Performing a Vitany analysis of a document (Menu <A href="menu_analyze.html">Analysis</A> \ Analyse Randomness)</h3>

<P>Vitany analysis is based on a publication by Paul Vitany, Ming Li and Tao Jiang (Kolmogorov Complexity and a Triangle Problem of the Heilbronn Type, http://www.cwi.nl/~paulv/papers/jlms.ps).</P>

<P>Here the characters of the current document are interpreted as the co-ordinates of points in a unit square. These are randomly linked to triangles whose surface area is then considered. For <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="gleichm.html">uniformly</A> distributed, <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="unabh.html">independent</A> (i.e. also cryptographically interesting) sets of points, the expected value for the smallest triangle is roughly proportional to the number of points to the third power.</P>

<P>The Vitany analysis is only executable for binary file input.</P>

<P>The diagram shows the proportionality constant as a function of the number of points. It is standardised to the mean (mean = 1.0). The mean and the standard variation are also output.</P>

<P>It is to be expected: </P>

<UL>

	<LI> that with a sequence that is not uniformly distributed the curve will decline and </LI>

	<LI> that in a sequence that is not independent the output graph will rise.</LI>

</UL>

<P><B>Example</B>:</P>

<P>Via the linear congruence generator (LCG parameter: a = 23, b = 0, Modul N = 100001) there were 12.500 "random" characters generated. The Vitany analysis outputs the following diagram:</P>

<h3>AES candidates</h3>

<P>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the US Department of Commerce began an initiative in 1997 under the name of "Advanced Encryption Standard" (AES) that was aimed at standardising a new algorithm which should replace the <A href="hid_crypt_des_desecb.html">DES algorithm</A> in future in all applications and on all platforms.</P>

<P>In a public and transparent process, one algorithm is to be selected as successor to the <A href="hid_crypt_des_desecb.html">DES</A> out of all the suggestions publicly submitted.</P>

<P>At the second AES Conference on 22/23 March 1999 in Rome, the algorithms which at the time were up for discussion and the analyses performed with them were presented and discussed. The conference was attended by approx. 180 persons from 23 countries, and 21 papers were presented.</P>

<P>In the first round there were 15 proposals, from which the final AES algorithm is to be selected over several stages. Further information on this is available from <a href="http://www.nist.gov/aes" target="_blank">http://www.nist.gov/aes</a>.</P>

<P>In the second round five proposals were left in the running, <A href="hid_crypt_aes_mars.html">MARS</A>, <A href="hid_crypt_aes_rc6.html">RC6</A>, <A href="hid_crypt_aes_rijndael.html">Rijndael</A>, <A href="hid_crypt_aes_serpent.html">Serpent</A> and <A href="hid_crypt_aes_twofish.html">Twofish</A>.</P>

<P>Requirements which a new algorithm must satisfy:</P>

<P>In an appeal issued by NIST on 12 September 1997 the following requirements which a successor to the DES must satisfy were defined.</P>

<P>Symmetric block cipher </P>

<UL>
	<LI>Must support as a minimum key lengths of 128,192 and 256 bits and a block length of 128 bits.</LI>

	<LI>Must be better than current algorithms: securer and more efficient (as regards runtime, space required on chip) than Triple-DES.</LI>

	<LI>Must be capable of being used in different application environments.</LI>

	<LI>Must be usable for Stream Cipher, Message Authentication Code (MAC) generator, pseudorandom number generator, hash function etc.</LI>

	<LI>Must be implementable on hardware and software.</LI>

	<LI>Must be available in the public domain all over the world.</LI>

	<LI>Security should be guaranteed for 20-30 years.</LI>

	<LI>The algorithm should be defined and evaluated publicly.</LI>
</UL>

<P>On 2 October 2000 the winner of the <A href="aes_gewinner.html">AES competition</A> was announced, and the Belgian Rijndael algorithm has been proposed for FIPS standardisation, thus being the designated successor to the now somewhat elderly <I>Data Encryption Standard.</I></P>

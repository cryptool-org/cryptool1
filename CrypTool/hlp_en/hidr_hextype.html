	<h3>Window for hexadecimal input and output</h3>

	<P>This window type is used to display <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="dokument.html">documents</A>
	which contain at least one non-displayable special character.</P>

	<P>According to the <A href="menu_edit.html">Edit</A>&nbsp;menu, characters can e.g. be 
	overwritten, removed or inserted.</P>

	<P><U>The window for hexadecimal input and output is designed as follows:</U></P>

	<P>The first column contains a serial hexadecimal number of the position of the 
	characters displayed in the other two columns.</P>

	<P>In the second column the characters are presented in hexadecimal form
	(see <A href="ascii.html">ASCII table</A>). One character is represented
       	by two characters one after the other (0, 1,..., 9, A, B,..., F).</P>

	<P>In the third column the displayable characters are shown in accordance with 
	their ASCII code. Non-displayable characters are depicted by a dot.</P>

	<P>If the hexadecimal value of a character is changed, the ASCII character 
	displayed is modified and vice versa.</P>

	<P>If you highlight hex characters in the middle, the according ASCII characters on 
	the right are highlighted too (and vice versa).</P>

	<P><IMG SRC="images/fenster_hex.gif" ALT="fenster_hex.gif" BORDER="0"></P>

	<P><!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="dokument.html">Documents</A> without any special 
	characters are displayed in a
       	<A href="hidr_texttype.html">window for textual input and output</A>.</P>

	<P>It is possible to force the display to take the form of a
	<A href="hidr_texttype.html">window for textual input and output</A> by
	selecting the menu option <A href="menu_view.html">View</A> \
       	<a href="hid_totxt.html">Show as Text</a>.<br>
	Note: This results in 
	loss of all characters behind the first ascii character 'NULL'
	(this text format character indicates the end of file) if the
	text file is stored. This character is shown as 'NUL'.</P>

	<P><b>Remark 1:</b><br>
		The values (decimal and hexadecimal) of the different ASCII characters can 
		be found in the <a href="ascii.html">ASCII table</a>.</P>
		
	<P><b>Remark 2:</b><br>
	In order to overwrite chracters with Ctrl-V (Paste) you first have
	to highlight the chracters.</p>

	<p><b>Remark 3: Search</b><br><br>
		a) You can search in two ways: In both, text modus and hex modus, only complete
		ASCII characters or strings can be searched.<br><br>
		
		b) Within hex modus you can look for both capital and small letters.<br><br>
			
		c) Using tab and shift-tab allows you to toggle the cursor between text and hex
		view.
		So you can see which ASCII character at the right side complies to
		which pair of hex characters at the left (at the left only the
		according right hex character of the pair is marked).<br><br>

		d) The editor starts its search from the last character of a marked area
		until the end of the file.<br><br>

		If you search only for one ASCII character then the marked one will be found first.
		If you search for a text string built by more than one character and if
		exactly such a string is marked in the editor, then the search is started behind
		the string!<br><br>

		If you want to search through the whole file, please set the cursor to the
	       	beginning of the file; or you could consider to use backwards search.<br><br>
		</P>

	<p><b>Remark 4: Fonts</b><br>
		Within the <A href="hidr_texttype.html">window for textual input and output</A>
		the used font can be changed via the menu item <a href="menu_view.html">View</a> \
	       	<a href="menu_view_font.html">Font</a>.
		Within the hex window the font is fixed.
		</P>

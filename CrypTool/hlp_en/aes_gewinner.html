<h3><P><A NAME="aes_gewinner"></A><B>The AES Winner Rijndael</B></P></h3>

<P>NIST (U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology) set up an international competition with the goal to create a new symmetric encryption algorithm that should be come a new standard in the USA. The competition ended on 2 October 2000 when Norman Y. Mineta declared Rijndael as the new national standard.</P>

<P>So Rijndael is the winner of the three year competition where a number of the most well known cryptographers were involved. Mineta said "finally this standard will serve as a tool for security critical IT-applications and will be a vehicle for a quick growth of eCommerce. Rijndael will enable eCommerce and eGovernment and will create new opportunities for all Americans." </P>

<P>NIST organized and supervised the competition which was strongly influenced by the private sector. NIST asked for suggestions for new algorithms since 12 September 1997. A considerable number of organizations from every region of the world answered this call. As a requirement NIST postulated that the algorithm supports the key lengths 128, 192 and 256. For a 128 bit key there are approximately 340,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000=34*10^37 possible keys.</P>

<P>Rijndael was developed by the Belgian cryptographers Joan Daemen from Proton-Welt International and Vincent Rijmen, member of the Catholic University Leuven. Both of them are known as very experienced members of the crypto community.</P>

<P>After the final acceptance AES will be a publicly available patent free standard used to protect long-term data. It will substitute the DES-Algorithm (Data Encryption Standard) which was introduced in 1977.</P>

<P>Until recently cryptography was mainly used for governmental and military purposes. Nowadays millions of people use cryptography without even noticing. It is used for internet-shopping or with automatic teller machines (ATM).</P>

<P>DES and a variant (Triple-DES) is today widely used, even in the private sector. The new AES-Algorithm will be implicitly used by millions of consumers and virtually all companies and service providers.</P>

<P>The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) became a US Federal standard on November 26, 2001 according to the document FIPS Publication 197. </P>

<P>At December 4, 2001 this was announced in a Federal Register Notice and in a press.</P>

<P>AES was developed to replace the Data Encryption Standard (DES) in a multi-year effort that began in 1997. The AES specifies a cryptographic algorithm that can be used to protect electronic data by encrypting (enciphering) and decrypting (deciphering) information. Details of the development process are available on the AES home page.</P>

<P><A NAME="hidd_sigattmodificdemo"></A><B>Dialogue Modification of a message by a hash value</B></P>

<P>In the category <B>Hash value</B> you have to enter both the <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="hashfunktion.html">hash value</A> (in hexadecimal notation) which determines the modification of the message and the <B>Significant bit length</B> which is the number of bits that shall be used for the modification.</P>

<P>In the category <B>Options for the modification of messages</B> the method of modifying messages depending on the entered hash value can be chosen.</P>

<P>If the radio button <B>Insert blanks</B> is checked, at least one of the two check boxes <B>In front of end of line</B> and <B>Double Blanks</B> has to be checked. Starting from the end of a message, a blank is inserted in front of an end of line and/or in front of another blank.</P>

<P><B>Attach characters</B> is the other method of modifying messages. There, two bits of a hash value are mapped on one character which is attached at the end of the message. For reasons of demonstration, <B>Printable characters</B> ("A", "B", "C" or "D") can be used, otherwise <B>Unprintable characters</B> (the characters with the ASCII codes 9, 10, 32 or 160) are attached.</P>

		<h3>Dialog Key Entry: Monoalphabetic Substitution / Atbash</h3>
		<P>You can reach this dialog via the menu entry <A href="menu_crypt.html">Encrypt/Decrypt</A>
			\ <a href="menu_crypt_symmetricclassic.html">Symmetric(classic)</a> \ <a href="HID_CryptMono.html">
				Substitution/Atbash</a>.</P>
		<P>This dialog is used to enter the <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="schluessel.html">key</A>
			for <A href="hid_cryptmono.html">monoalphabetic substitution</A>, and accordingly for the special case <A href="hid_cryptmono.html">Atbash</a>.</P>
		<P>For Atbash the key is fixed and is completely transferred to the key entry 
			field.</p><p>
			For the general monoalphabetic substitution they key entry field has to be 
			filled bei yourself.</P>

		<P>When entering the key the following should be noted: The dialog only accepts those characters that 
		are part of the alphabet set in the <a href="hidd_text_options.html">Text Options</a> dialog. All other 
		characters are automatically rejected, i.e. they are not displayed.</P>

		<P>There are two ways of entering the key:
		</P>
		<OL>
			<LI>
				<p>You select Atbash. So a fixed key is chosen.</p>
			<LI><p>
				You enter a keyword from which the permutation of the alphabet is derived. An 
				example here might be the keyword "RAILWAYS".</p><p> The resulting permutation is 
				worked out as follows. The A is mapped to the first letter (in this case the 
				R). Similarly, the B is mapped to A, the C to I, the D to L and the E to W. As 
				the sixth letter of the keyword, the A, has already occurred it is passed over, 
				since no two (different) letters can be mapped to the same letter. This 
				continues until all the letters in the keyword have been mapped, i.e. F to Y 
				and G to S. For all the other letters (in this case H to Z) there are two options how to map 
				them,</p>
				
				<ul type="a"><li>in reversed order:<br>
				i.e. H to Z, I to Y, ..., Z to C.<br>
				</li><li>
					in ascending order:<br>
				i.e. H to C, I to D, ..., Z to Z.<br></li>
			</ul>
			<p>If the entered keyword contains all 26 characters of the alphabet, then it doesn't matter, how to fill up.<br>The sequence of all the 26 different alphabet characters is also called a permutation of the alphabet.</p></LI>
		</OL>

		<P>After you have entered the key, you can encrypt the document by clicking on the <B>Encrypt</B>
			button or decrypt the document by selecting <B>Decrypt</B>.</P>
		<P>The formatting (retention of the spaces, special characters and upper and lower 
			case distinction) of the output of the encrypted or decrypted document can be 
			set in the <A href="hid_opttext.html">Text Options</A> dialog.</P>

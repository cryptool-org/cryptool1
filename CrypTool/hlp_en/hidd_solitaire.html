<IMG SRC="images/Solitaire_Dialog.gif" BORDER=0>


<p>This dialogue serves to generate a keystream with the Solitaire algorithm.
</p>
<p>
<B>Annotation</B><br>
If your plaintext or your ciphertext consist of more than 65.535 letters, the rest of the text is cutted. In this case an information-box appears at the beginning of the dialogue.
</p>
<p>This keystream can be used for encryption of a plaintext as well as for decryption of a Solitaire ciphertext. These different procedures differenciates each other only by clicking either the <B>Encrypt</B> or the <B>Decrypt</B> Button. The plaintext or the ciphertext have to be opened in CrypTool as a document, before you start this dialogue.
</p>
<p>
<B>Annotation:</B><br>CrypTool has the possibility to absolve an automatical or semi-automatical cryptanalysis (<a href="HID_ANALYSE_SYMMCLASSIC_CIPHERTEXTOLY_SOLITAIRE.html">Solitaire analysis</a>) on a ciphertext, which is encrypted with Solitaire.
</p>

<p><U>To the keystream generation</U></p>
<p>Please follow the numbers of the frames (groupings) in this dialogue (1. to 3.). If you want to correct something in a previous frame, please restart with frame 1.
</p>


<p><B>Grouping 1 a: Number of cards (classic: 52 +2)</B><br>
Please choose the number of cards for passing through the <a href="HID_SYMCLASSIC_SOLITAIRE.html">Solitaire algorithm</a>.<br>
Usually 54 cards are used (52 + 2 jokers). This number of cards is also recommended by the developper of the algorithm Bruce Schneier and is the default value.<br>
Also it is possible to use less than 54 cards (not less than 3 = 1 + 2 jokers).
</p>
<IMG SRC="images/Solitaire_Kartenanzahl.gif" BORDER=0>



<p><B>Grouping 1b: Defining the cards' order</B><br>
Please choose the prefered <a href="kartendeck.html">initial deck</a>. There are six different possibilities. The "Ascending" order is the default value.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><U>Ascending:</U> sorts the cards in ascending order (starting with the lowest).</li>
<li><U>Descending:</U> sorts the cards in descending order (starting with the highest).</li>
<li><U>Shuffle:</U> shuffles the cards with a random function(can be repeated).</li>
<li><U>Own Choice:</U> You choose the position of the cards by yourself (then continue with grouping "Optional -> Own Choice").</li>
<li><U>Load Initialdeck:</U> You load the initial deck.</li>
<li><U>Load Finaldeck:</U> You load the final deck.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
For decryption in this grouping the same initial deck has to be chosen as the one, which was used for encryption.
</p>

<IMG SRC="images/Solitaire_Art.gif" BORDER=0>

<p><B>Grouping: "Optional: Enter password"</B><br>
After choosing the order of cards in grouping 1 b., you can modifiy the initial deck through a password. Enter the password (max 1024 letters), other signs are depressed. Is your password entered correctly, click the Button <B>Modify the initial deck</B> and the password modifies the card order. You can also click the button more than once. For each time the password will be modifiy the card deck once more.<br>
For decryption you have to enter the same password and to click the Button <B>Modify the initial deck</B>as often, as for the encryption.<br>
For Example: If you enter the password "<I>test</I>" and click the Button <B>Modify the initial deck</B> twice it has the same result as you enter the password "<I>testtest</I>" and click the Button <B>Modify the initial deck</B> once.  
</p>

<p><B>Grouping: "Optional: Own Choice"</B><br>
This grouping is only activated, if you chose "Own Choice" in grouping 1 b.. Please construct your prefered initial deck by clicking the Buttons <B>1-54</B> in your wished order. if you make a mistake, please click the <B>Reset</B>-Button and restart your enter. The values on the buttons represents the card values, as you can see in the <a href="HID_SYMCLASSIC_SOLITAIRE.html">Solitaire description</a>. While you are constructing your initial deck, you can see the current <a href="kartendeck.html">deck</a> in the output field "Initial deck" in the grouping "Output of the different states of the card deck and of the generated keystream". When you reach the number of cards, which you chose in 1 a., this grouping becomes deactivated.
</p>
<IMG SRC="images/Solitaire_Vorgabe.gif" BORDER=0>

<p><B>Grouping 2: Generating the keystream (automatically or manually)</B><br>
This grouping gives two alternatives for generating the keystream.
</p>
<IMG SRC="images/Solitaire_schluesselerzeugung.gif" BORDER=0>
<p>
<ul><li><B>Automatical</B></li><br>
This button starts all 5 steps of the Solitaire algorithm to generate the keystream automatically as often, as the number of plaintext letters.<br>
After that you can see the "final deck" in the grouping "Output of the different states of the card deck and of the generated keystream". This output represents the order of the <a href="kartendeck.html">card deck</a> after generating the keystream.<br>
The field "keystream" shows the keystream, which is used for en-/decryption.<br><br>
<li><B>Manual</B></li><br>
This button gives the possibility to pass through the Solitaire algorithm manually. After clicking this button, the grouping 2 a. becomes active and you can do the algorithm step by step.
</ul>
<B>Annotation</B>:<br>
If you chose in grouping 1b. "Own Choice", these two buttons become active, when the initial deck is completed. That means if each active button in grouping "Own Choice" is clicked.
</p>

<p><B>Grouping 2 a:  Manual steps of the Solitaire algorithm</B><br>
This grouping becomes active if you clicked in grouping 2 the <B>Manual</B> button. If you want to do in the same way, the actual Solitaire algorithm does, click the buttons (Step 1 bis Step 5) in ascending order. Until enough keystream letters are generated. After each step you can see the modification of the <a href="kartendeck.html">card deck</a> in the output field "Final deck". A new keystream letter is only generated in step 5.<br><br>
</p>
<IMG SRC="images/Solitaire_schritte.gif" BORDER=0>
<p>
<B>Annotation</B>:<br>
Consists your plaintext for example 100 letters and you generated only 15 keystream letters yet (manually), you can click the Button <B>Generate rest</B>. So the last keystream letters (here: 100-15) are generated  automatically. In the small text field beside the button <B>Step 5</B> you can see the number of created keystream letters and the number of needed keystream letters.<br>
After generating a keystream, with the same number of letters as the plaintext/ciphertext (max 65.535), the buttons <B>Encrypt</B>, <B>Decrypt</B> and the 3 <B>Save</B> buttons becomes active.
</p>


<p><B>Save</B><br>
<ul>
<li>If you click the upper <B>Save</B> button, the current initial deck is saved to the textfile "<I>StoredLastInitialdeck.txt</I>" into the CrypTool folder on your hard disk.</li>
<li>If you click the <B>Save</B> button in the middle, the current final deck is saved to the textfile "<I>StoredLastFinaldeck.txt</I>" into the CrypTool folder on your hard disk.</li>
<li>If you click the beneath <B>Save</B> button, the keystream is saved to the textfile "<I>StoredLastKeystream.txt</I>" into the CrypTool folder on your hard disk.</li>
</ul>
</p>



<p><B>Encrypt</B><br>
If you click this button the ciphertext is generated by using the keystream and the plaintext.
</p>

<p><B>Decrypt</B><br>
If you click this button the plaintext is generated by using the keystream and the ciphertext.
</p>
<p>
After clicking these buttons <B>Encrypt</B> / <B>Decrypt</B> you leave the dialogue and the created ciphertext or the created plaintext appears in a new file in the CrypTool main window.
</p>
<p><B>Cancel</B><br>
With this button you can leave the dialogue always.

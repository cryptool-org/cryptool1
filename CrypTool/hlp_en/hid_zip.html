<P><A NAME="hid_zip"></A><B>Document compression (Zip) (Menu <A href="menu_related_methods.html">Individual Procedures</A></B> \<B> Compress)</B></P>

<P>The Compress (Zip) function is used to compress data. When the Zip function is selected, the contents of the current <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="dokument.html">document</A> are compressed and the results are presented in a new <A href="hidr_hextype.html">window</A>. The original documents can be restored at a later time by selecting the <A href="hid_unzip.html">UnZip</A> function.</P>

<P>There are a number of data compression algorithms available. <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="cryptool.html">CrypTool</A> uses the GnuZip algorithm.</P>

<P>Before the results are presented in a new window, the rate of compression is stated as a percentage. The rate of compression states the percentage by which it has been possible to compress (i.e. reduce) a document. If the rate of compression is 10%, then the compressed document is 10% shorter than the <A href="hid_unzip.html">uncompressed</A> version. With short documents or documents that have already been compressed it is possible for the compressed <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="dokument.html">document</A> to actually be a few characters longer. This is expressed as a negative rate of compression. Thus, if the rate of compression is -10%, then the compressed document is 10% longer than the uncompressed version.</P>

<P>As well as their smaller size, a second characteristic of compressed files is that if they contain text written in natural language, the redundancy of the data is reduced. Normally this will make an attack more difficult. For this reason the <A href="pgp.html">PGP</A> (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption program, for example, compresses the data prior to actually <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="verschluesselung.html">encrypting</A> it. The packets containing <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="verschluesselung.html">encrypted</A> text are thus generally significantly smaller as a result while at the same time they are more secure as <A href="angriffe.html">attacks</A> are more difficult.</P>

<P>The <A href="hid_hilfe_szenarien.html">Examples</A> chapter contains an <A href="szenarien_xor.html">example</A> in which the <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="schluessel.html">key</A> can be found in a <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="ciphertextonlyangriff.html">Ciphertext-Only attack</A> if the document has been <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="verschluesselung.html">encrypted</A> using the <A href="hid_xor_bin.html">Exclusive-OR</A>, but not if the document has been previously compressed.</P>

<h3>What is PGP, OpenPGP, GnuPG, Gpg4win ... ?</h3>

<P>PGP is short for Pretty Good Privacy. As OpenPGP it is the de-facto standard
for privacy and secure communication in the Internet in the private area.
The software package PGP was originally developed by Phil Zimmermann and provides 
strong encryption and digital signature for emails and files. The first version
of PGP was available as early as June 5th 1991. It is well-known for helping to
defend the right and freedom of private electronic communication.</P>

<P>In the following the (changeful) history of PGP and the current
open-source products are explained.</P>

<P><B><u>Status in June 2002</u></B>:</P>

<P><b>a)</b> The company NAI had bought PGP and developed the Windows version.
PGP now was a commercial product and no open-source product any more. After
releasing the client version 7.03 NAI stopped developing and supporting the
program any further. NAI neither could find a new owner nor were they willing
to give their version to the Internet community as open source till then.
Phil Zimmermann said, now (his) PGP is accessible 
for no one anymore – captured in a "prison of intellectual property".</P>

<P><b>b)</b> Because no PGP source code had been released since version 2.6.3,
the open-source project GPG = <B>GnuPG</B> (GNU privacy guard) was started.
GPG developed the open source program which also implements the <B>OpenPG</B>
standard (RFC 2440), which was developed based on PGP, and is therefore
compatible to PGP. GnuPG version 1.0 was published in 1999 and, till today, it
founds the basis of other open source PGP packages.
<br>URL: <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/" target="_blank">www.gnupg.org</a></P>

<P><b>c)</b> The German government [German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWA/BMWi) and the 
German Federal Ministry of the Interior (BMI)] started to fund the command line-oriented project GnuPG 
(<a href="http://www.gnupp.org/" target="_blank">www.gnupp.de</a>) – with the goal to offer a 
package named <B>GnuPP</B> increasing the user friendliness, especially on the Windows platform, by adding a 
graphical user interface and plug-ins.</P>


<P><B><U>Status in February 2003</U></B>:</P>

<P><b>a)</b> The new company PGP corporation, of which Phil Zimmermann is also
a stake holder, bought PGP back. An English version of PGP 8.0 was released for
Windows (incl. Windows XP) and Macintosh (Instructions in German can be found
at <a href="www.helmbold.de/pgp" target="_blank">www.helmbold.de/pgp</a>).
There is a version for non-commercial usage and the sources are also published
again. Phil Zimmermann emphasized in a talk given at January 30, 2003: As long
as he can decide, the source code will continue to be published and there will
be no intended trapdoors within PGP.<br>
URL: <a href="http://www.pgp.com/" target="_blank">www.pgp.com</a></P>

<P><b>b)</b> The current version of the open source package GnuPP is 1.1 – also
available for all Windows versions (including Windows XP). It is based on
GnuPG 1.06 (the base system GnuPG already achieved version 1.2.1 and is also
available for Linux).
<br>The package GnuPP can encrypt files, e-mails, the clipboard or the content
of the active window.<br>GnuPP can be used as freeware both privately and 
commercially. The software offers a German and an English interface with two
introductions: one for beginners and one for experienced users. The assistant
GPA is especially helpful for users without crypto-experience in order to
generate and manage keys.
<br>Same as PGP 8.0, GnuPP does deliver many plug-ins for email programs 
(like Outlook, The Bat, Eudora and Pegasus).</P>



<P><b><u>Status January 2004</u></b>:</p>

The GnuPP initiative is no longer active. The last update of the project 
web site dates September 2003. The successor of GnuPP is Gpg4win (see below).
</P>



<br>
<P><B><U>Status October 2016 -- Good News</U></B>:</P>

<P><b>a)</b> Since 2005 release 9.0 of PGP Desktop is available.
PGP Corporation spreaded its product line further (e.g. PGP Whole Disk
Encryption or PGP Support Package
for BlackBerry) and build up the so-called PGP Encryption Platform.<br>

In an official letter to the PGP Community CEO, Philip Dunkelberger, 
strengthens PGP's commitment to continue to publish the source code in order to
enable the community to conduct code reviews and to maintain customer trust.<br>

However, the source code is mainly available for the product PGP Desktop, and
even there the build tools are not included in the package. These build tools
can only be obtained at charge via PGP Professional Services.<br>

Besides the founder Phil Zimmermann, PGP's technical advisory board consisted
of some known experts such as Bruce Schneier or Dr. Crispin Cowan. In June 2010
Symantec Corporation acquired PGP.<br>

Meanwhile, there are free versions with a similar and often more current
functionality as the PGP from PGP Corporation / Symantec.</P>



<P><b>b)</b> The <B>GnuPG</B> project
(<a href="http://www.gnupg.org" target="_blank">www.gnupg.org</a>), lead by Werner Koch,
develops since 1997 the free basis software (the actual signing and encryption program)
as a command line program for several operating systems.
<br>The GnuPG project is very active, in the meantime also well-funded, and continuously
publishes new versions:
As of September 2016 the current GnuPG versions are 1.7.0 and 2.1.15. 
<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard" target="_blank">Here</a>
you can find further information about GnuPG.</P>



<P><b>c)</b> There are two constantly active open-source projects which 
integrate the complete package of GnuPG into graphical front-ends.
Additionally they offer installation packages for Windows (and thus are
completely replacing GnuPP and are as well a valid replacement for the
according commercial PGP software):</P>

<UL>
	<li><B>Gpg4win</B>:<br>
	Gpg4win is a free and complete substitute for the original PGP for
       	the operating system Windows.
	The installation package contains programs and documentation
	for file encryption, key management and secure e-mail.<br>
	It is available in English and German.<br>
	It includes exhaustive manuals, also for beginners. In the opposite to its
	manuals the software gets updates regularily and very often.<br>
	Current version: 2.3.3 (August 2016).<br>
	<a href="http://www.gpg4win.org" target="_blank">www.gpg4win.org</a>
        (mature and stable project, supported by the German Information Security Agency BSI)
	<UL>
		<LI>The program <U>Kleopatra</U> can be used to manage X509
		certificates as well as PGP keys.</LI>
		<LI>The Outlook plugin <U>GPGol</U> allows encryption
	        via PGP and S/MIME.</LI>
		<LI>The Windows Explorer plugin <U>GpgEX</U> enables
	        crypto operations on files and directories.</LI>
		<LI>Gpg4win supports using SmartCards for OpenPGP and S/MIME.</LI>
	</UL>
	</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
	<li><B>GnuPG Pack</B>:<br>
	GnuPG Pack is also a free and complete substitute for the original PGP.
	The installer contains the encryption program GnuPG, the frontend
	WinPT Tray for key management, documentation and plugins for 
	different mail clients plus PGPdump and Stunnel with OpenSSL.<br>
	It is available in English and German.<br>
	This package exists since 2003 and gets updates regularily and very often.<br>
	Current version: 16.2.2 (October 2016).<br>
	<a href="http://home.arcor.de/rose-indorf/" target="_blank">http://home.arcor.de/rose-indorf/</a>
	</li>
</UL>

<br>
<P><b>d)</b> The project <B>Enigmail</B>
(<a href="http://enigmail.mozdev.org" target="_blank">http://enigmail.mozdev.org</a>)
offers a widely used plug-in for the mail client
<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird" target="_blank">Thunderbird</a>.
This is useful for secure e-mail establishing both the S/MIME and the OpenPGP standard
(offering encryption and signature of e-mails).<br>
For the variant OpenPGP, again GnuPG is used.<br>
Current version (September 2016): Enigmail v1.9.5 for Thunderbird 45.4.</P>

<br>
<P><b>e)</b> The new and very promising project <B>OpenPGP.js</B>
(<a href="https://openpgpjs.org/" target="_blank">https://openpgpjs.org/</a>)
offers a free and open-source JavaScript implementation of the OpenPGP protocol (defined in RFC 4880).<br><br>

"This project aims to provide an Open Source OpenPGP library in JavaScript so it can be used on virtually every device. Instead of other plugins that are aimed at using e.g. NPAPI (meaning they are intended to run native code), OpenPGP.js is meant to bypass this requirement (people will not have to install gpg on their machines in order to use the software). The idea is to implement all the needed OpenPGP functionality in a JavaScript library and to reuse it in other projects. It should allow you to sign, encrypt, decrypt, and verify any kind of text -- in particular e-mails -- as well as managing keys.<br>

OpenPGP.js has received a first complete audit of its codebase conducted by Cure53. The audit started in Feb 2014 and was sponsored by the Open Technology Fund (RFA)."<br><br>

OpenPGP.js is also part of Mailvelope (<a href="https://www.mailvelope.com/" target="_blank">https://www.mailvelope.com/</a>), a browser extension that enables the exchange of encrypted emails following the OpenPGP encryption standard (current version 10/07/2016: 1.5.1).<br><br>

Mailvelope and OpenPGP.js are productively is use with more than 600,000 users at web.de and GMX.DE. These two email providers are the first who rolled out very easy-to-use end-to-end encryption in high numbers to the enduser -- but only with their own user group.<br><br>

As a predecessor of OpenPGP.js, one could consider <B>GPG4Browsers</B>
(<a href="http://gpg4browsers.recurity.com/" target="_blank">http://gpg4browsers.recurity.com/</a>)
which started in November 2011 to implement the OpenPGP message format in JavaScript 
as Chrome extension and for integration into Googlemail.<br><br>
</P>


<P><b>f)</b> Another upcoming and very promising project is <B>p=p (Pretty Easy Privacy)</B> by the Swiss-based foundation
(<a href="https://pep.foundation/about/foundation/index.html" target="_blank">https://pep.foundation/about/foundation/index.html</a>),
which intends to encrypt all digital communication fully automatically ("Privacy by Default").
This supports PGP and S/MIME when using email, but also other protocols and tools like messengers.<br>
Their software is open-source; their products are free when applied within open-source and free products.<br><br>

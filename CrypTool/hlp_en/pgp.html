<P><A NAME="pgp"></A><B>What is PGP?</B></P>

<P>PGP (short for Pretty Good Privacy) is the standard for privacy and secure communication in the Internet in the private area. The software package was originally developed by Phil Zimmermann and provides encryption and digital signature for emails and files. The first version of PGP was available as early as June 5th 1991. It is well-known for helping to defend the right and freedom of private electronic communication.</P>

<P><U>Status in June 2002:</U></P>

<P>The company NAI had bought PGP and developed the Windows version. After releasing the client version 7.03 NAI stopped developing and supporting the program any further. NAI neither could find a new owner nor were they willing to give their version to the Internet community as open source till then. Phil Zimmermann said, now (his) PGP is accessible for no one anymore – captured in a "prison of intellectual property".</P>

<P>Because no PGP source code had been released since version 2.6.3, an open source project was started: GunPG (GNU privacy guard).  Here an open source program is developed which also implements the OpenPGP standard (RFC 2440), which was developed based on PGP, and is therefore compatible to PGP. GnuPG version 1.0 was published in 1999.</P>

<P>Recently the German government started to fund the command line-oriented project GnuPG intensively – with the goal to offer a packet named GnuPP increasing the user friendliness, especially on the Windows platform, by adding a graphical user interface and plug-ins.</P>

<P><U>Status in February 2003:</U></P>

<P>The new company <U>PGP</U> corporation, of which Phil Zimmermann is also a stake holder, bought PGP back. Recently a English version of PGP 8.0 was released for Windows (incl. Windows XP) and Macintosh (Instructions in German can be found at www.helmbold.de/pgp). There is a version for non-commercial usage and the sources are also published again. Phil Zimmermann emphasized in a talk given at January 30, 2003: as long as he can decide, the source code will continue to be published and there will be no intended trapdoors within PGP.</P>

<P>The current version of the <U>open source package GnuPP</U> is 1.1 – also available for all Windows versions (including Windows XP).  It is based on GnuPG 1.06 (the base system GnuPG already achieved version 1.2.1 and is also available for Linux).<BR>
The package GnuPP can encrypt directly files, e-mails, the clipboard or the content of the active window.<BR>
GnuPP can be used as freeware both privately and commercially. The software offers a German and an English interface with 2 introductions: one for beginners and one for experienced users. The assistant GPA is especially helpful for users without crypto-experience in order to generate and manage keys (http://www.gnupp.com/bedienung.html).<BR>
As PGP 8.0 does GnuPP deliver many plug-ins for email programs (like Outlook, The Bat, Eudora and Pegasus).</P>

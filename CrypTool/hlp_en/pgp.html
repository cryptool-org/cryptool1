<h3>What is PGP?</h3>

<P>PGP (short for Pretty Good Privacy) is the de-facto standard for privacy and secure communication in the 
Internet in the private area. The software package was originally developed by Phil Zimmermann and provides 
strong encryption and digital signature for emails and files. The first version of PGP was available as early 
as June 5th 1991. It is well-known for helping to defend the right and freedom of private electronic 
communication.</P>

<P><B><u>Status in June 2002</u></B>:</P>

<P><b>a)</b> The company NAI had bought PGP and developed the Windows version. PGP now was a commercial 
product and no open-source product any more. After releasing the client version 7.03 NAI stopped developing 
and supporting the program any further. NAI neither could find a new owner nor were they willing to give their 
version to the Internet community as open source till then. Phil Zimmermann said, now (his) PGP is accessible 
for no one anymore – captured in a "prison of intellectual property".
<br><br>Because no PGP source code had been released since version 2.6.3,
an open source project was started: GPG = <B>GnuPG</B> (GNU privacy guard).
Here an open source program was developed which also implements the OpenPGP
standard (RFC 2440), which was developed based on PGP, and is therefore
compatible to PGP. GnuPG version 1.0 was published in 1999 and founds the basis 
of other open source PGP packages.
<br>URL: <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/" target="_blank">www.gnupg.org</a></P>

<P><b>b)</b> The German government [German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWA/BMWi) and the 
German Federal Ministry of the Interior (BMI)] started to fund the command line-oriented project GnuPG 
(<a href="http://www.gnupp.org/" target="_blank">www.gnupp.de</a>) – with the goal to offer a 
packet named <B>GnuPP</B> increasing the user friendliness, especially on the Windows platform, by adding a 
graphical user interface and plug-ins.</P>


<P><B><U>Status in February 2003</U></B>:</P>

<P><b>a)</b> The new company PGP corporation, of which Phil Zimmermann is also a stake holder, bought PGP 
back. English version of PGP 8.0 was released for Windows (incl. Windows XP) and Macintosh (Instructions 
in German can be found at <a href="www.helmbold.de/pgp" target="_blank">www.helmbold.de/pgp</a>). There is a version for non-commercial usage and the sources 
are also published again. Phil Zimmermann emphasized in a talk given at January 30, 2003: As long as he can 
decide, the source code will continue to be published and there will be no intended trapdoors within PGP.<br>
URL: <a href="http://www.pgp.com/" target="_blank">www.pgp.com</a></P>

<P><b>b)</b> The current version of the open source package GnuPP is 1.1 – also available for all Windows 
versions (including Windows XP). It is based on GnuPG 1.06 (the base system GnuPG already achieved version 
1.2.1 and is also available for Linux).<br>The package GnuPP can encrypt directly files, e-mails, the 
clipboard or the content of the active window.<br>GnuPP can be used as freeware both privately and 
commercially. The software offers a German and an English interface with two introductions: one for beginners 
and one for experienced users. The assistant GPA is especially helpful for users without crypto-experience 
in order to generate and manage keys.<br>As PGP 8.0 does GnuPP deliver many plug-ins for email programs 
(like Outlook, The Bat, Eudora and Pegasus).</P>

<P><B>Remark</B>:</P>

<P>The GnuPP initiative for a free graphical front-end is no longer active. The last update of the project 
web site dates September 2003.</P>


<P><B><U>Status April 2010</U></B>:</P>

<P><b>a)</b> Since 2005 release 9.0 of PGP Desktop is available. This release features instant messaging 
(AOL) communication encryption and supports two factor authentication via smart cards.
PGP Corporation spreaded its product line further (e.g. PGP Whole Disk Encryption or PGP Support Package
for BlackBerry) and build up the so-called PGP Encryption Platform.<br>

In an official letter to the PGP Community CEO, Philip Dunkelberger, 
strengthens PGP's commitment to continue to publish the source code in order to enable the community to 
conduct code reviews and to maintain customer trust.<br>

However, the source code is mainly available for the 
product PGP Desktop, and even there the build tools are not included in the package. These build tools can 
only be obtained at charge via PGP Professional Services. With regard to the available sources PGP speaks of 
more than 3.000 downloads per month.<br>

Besides the founder Phil Zimmermann, PGP's technical advisory board 
consists of some known experts such as Bruce Schneier or Dr. Crispin Cowan. Meanwhile there are free versions 
with a similar functional range as the original PGP.</P>

<P><b>b)</b> The <B>GnuPG</B> project (<a href="http://www.gnupg.org" target="_blank">www.gnupg.org</a>) develops 
since 1997 the free basis software (the actual signing and encryption software) as a command line program for 
several operating systems. The GnuPG project is very active and continuously publishes new versions: Since 
March 2010 the GnuPG versions 1.4.9 and 2.0.15 are available. 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard" target="_blank">Here</a> you can find further 
information about GnuPG.</P>

<P><b>c)</b> Two other projects are active since a while: They use
GnuPG as basis and integrate the complete package of GnuPG into 
graphical front-ends. Additionally they offer installation packages
for Windows (and thus replacing GnuPP):</P>

<UL>
	<li><B>Gpg4win</B>:<br>
	Gpg4win is a free and complete substitute for the original PGP for the operating system Windows.
	The installation package contains programs programs and documentation
	for file encryption, key management and secure e-mail.<br>
	It is available in English and German.<br>
	It includes exhaustive manuals, also for beginners.<br>
	Current version: 2.0.2 (April 2010).<br>
	<a href="http://www.gpg4win.org" target="_blank">www.gpg4win.org</a> (supported by the
       	German Information Security Agency BSI)

	<UL>
		<LI>The program <U>Kleopatra</U> can be used to manage X509
		certificates as well as PGP keys.</LI>
		<LI>The Outlook plugin <U>GPGol</U> allows encryption via PGP and S/MIME.</LI>
		<LI>The Windows Explorer plugin <U>GpgEX</U> enables crypto operations on files.</LI>
	</UL>
	</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
	<li><B>GnuPG Pack</B>:<br>
	Installer for GnuPG, key management, documentation plus Stunnel with OpenSSL.<br>
	It is available in English and German.<br>
	This package exists since 2003 and delivers regular updates.<br>
	Current version: 10.4.4 (April 2010).<br>
	<a href="http://home.arcor.de/rose-indorf/" target="_blank">http://home.arcor.de/rose-indorf/</a>
	</li>
</UL>


<P><b>d)</b> The project <B>Enigmail</B>
(<a href="http://enigmail.mozdev.org" target="_blank">http://enigmail.mozdev.org</a>)
offers a widely used plug-in for the mail client Thunderbird.
This is useful for secure e-mail establishing both the S/MIME and the OpenPGP standard
(offering encryption and signature of e-mails).<br>
For the variant Open-PGP again GnuPG is used.</P>

<h3>What is PGP?</h3>
<p>
PGP (short for Pretty Good Privacy) is the standard for privacy and secure communication in the Internet in the private area. The software package was originally developed by Phil Zimmermann and provides encryption and digital signature for emails and files. The first version of PGP was available as early as June 5th 1991. It is well-known for helping to defend the right and freedom of private electronic communication.</p>

<p><b><u>Status in June 2002:</u></b></p><p>
<b>a)</b> The company NAI had bought PGP and developed the Windows version. After releasing the client version 7.03 NAI stopped developing and supporting the program any further. NAI neither could find a new owner nor were they willing to give their version to the Internet community as open source till then. Phil Zimmermann said, now (his) PGP is accessible for no one anymore – captured in a "prison of intellectual property".<br>
Because no PGP source code had been released since version 2.6.3, an open source project was started: GPG = GnuPG (GNU privacy guard). Here an open source program is developed which also implements the OpenPGP standard (RFC 2440), which was developed based on PGP, and is therefore compatible to PGP. GnuPG version 1.0 was published in 1999 and founds the basis of other open source PGP packages.<br></p><p>

<p>
<b>b)</b> The German government [German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWA/BMWi) and the German Federal Ministry of the Interior (BMI)] started to fund the command line-oriented project GnuPG (<a href="http://www.gnupp.org/" target="_blank">www.gnupp.de</a>) intensively – with the goal to offer a packet named GnuPP increasing the user friendliness, especially on the Windows platform, by adding a graphical user interface and plug-ins.<br><br></p>


<p><b><u>Status in February 2003:</u></b></p>
<b>a)</b> The new company PGP corporation, of which Phil Zimmermann is also a stake holder, bought PGP back. English version of PGP 8.0 was released for Windows (incl. Windows XP) and Macintosh (Instructions in German can be found at www.helmbold.de/pgp). There is a version for non-commercial usage and the sources are also published again. Phil Zimmermann emphasized in a talk given at January 30, 2003: As long as he can decide, the source code will continue to be published and there will be no intended trapdoors within PGP.<br></p><p>

<p>
<b>b)</b> The current version of the open source package GnuPP is 1.1 – also available for all Windows versions (including Windows XP). It is based on GnuPG 1.06 (the base system GnuPG already achieved version 1.2.1 and is also available for Linux).<br>
The package GnuPP can encrypt directly files, e-mails, the clipboard or the content of the active window.<br>
GnuPP can be used as freeware both privately and commercially. The software offers a German and an English interface with 2 introductions: one for beginners and one for experienced users. The assistant GPA is especially helpful for users without crypto-experience in order to generate and manage keys.<br>
As PGP 8.0 does GnuPP deliver many plug-ins for email programs (like Outlook, The Bat, Eudora and Pegasus).<br><br></p>

<P><b>Remark:</b><br> The GnuPP initiative for a free graphical front-end is no longer active. The last update of the project web site dates September 2003.</P><br>

<p><b><u>Status today: September 2009:</u></b></p>

<b>a)</b> Since 2005 release 9.0 of PGP Desktop is available. This release features instant messaging (AOL) communication encryption and supports two factor authentication via smart cards. New product lines extend PGP's range of applications (e.g. PGP Whole Disk Encryption or PGP Support Package for BlackBerry) and build up the PGP Encryption Platform. In an official letter to the PGP Community CEO, Philip Dunkelberger, strengthens PGP's commitment to continue to publish the source code in order to enable the community to conduct code reviews and to maintain customer trust. However, the source code is mainly available for the product PGP Desktop, and even there the build tools are not included in the package. These build tools can only be obtained at charge via PGP Professional Services. With regard to the available sources PGP speaks of more than 3.000 downloads per month. Besides the founder Phil Zimmermann, PGP's technical advisory board consists of some known experts such as Bruce Schneier or Dr. Crispin Cowan. Meanwhile there are free versions with a similar functional range as the original PGP.</p>
<p>
<b>b)</b> The GnuPG project (<a href="http://www.gnupg.org" target="_blank">www.gnupg.org</a>) develops since 1997 the free basis software (the actual signing and encryption software) as a command line program for several operating systems. The GnuPG project is very active and continuously publishes new versions: Since September 2009 the GnuPG versions 1.4.9 and 2.0.10 are available. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard" target="_blank">Here</a> you can find further information about GnuPG.</p>
<b>c)</b> Two other projects are active since a while: They integrate the complete package of GnuPG into graphical front-ends and offer installation packages for Windows (and thus replacing GnuPP):<br><ul type="disc">
<li>Gpg4win: Installation package for Windows containing programs and documentation for file encryption, key management and secure e-mail, English and German.<br>
Current version: 2.0.0 (August 2009).<br>
<a href="http://www.gpg4win.org" target="_blank">www.gpg4win.org</a> (supported by the German Information Security Agency BSI)<br>
<UL>
<LI>The program <U>Kleopatra</U> can be used to manage X509 certificates as well as PGP keys.</LI>
<LI>The Outlook plugin <U>GPGol</U> allows encryption via PGP and S/MIME.</LI>
<LI>The Windows Explorer plugin <U>GpgEX</U> enables cryto operations on files.</LI>
</UL>
</li>

<li>GnuPG Pack: Installer for GnuPG, key management, documentation plus Stunnel with OpenSSL. This package exists since 2003 and delivers regular updates.<br>
Current version: 9.7.9 (September 2009).<br>

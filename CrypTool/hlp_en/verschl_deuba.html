<P><A NAME="verschl_deuba"></A><B>Use of encryption algorithms at the Deutsche Bank</B></P>

<P>Cryptographic algorithms and protocols form the basis for many different security mechanisms and security services, such as, for example,</P>

<P>protection of the confidentiality of documents,</P>

<P>proof of the origin of messages,</P>

<P>user authentication (authenticity),</P>

<P>assurance of the binding nature of transactions (non-repudiation),</P>

<P>assurance of the integrity of data.</P>

<P>These security mechanisms and services are used in many different applications, for which they have to be implemented on many different system platforms, from smart cards through to mainframe computers.</P>

<P>At the Deutsche Bank cryptographic algorithms are used in some very different areas. For example,</P>

<P>Internally:</P>

<P>to protect e-mails and file transfers</P>

<P>for remote access</P>

<P>to encrypt hard disks on PCs</P>

<P>To protect customer applications:</P>

<P>Internet banking and Internet broking</P>

<P>home banking (HBCI)</P>

<P>electronic banking (BCS)</P>

<P>smart card applications (money card (GeldKarte), ec card with chip)</P>

<P>electronic money (e-cash)</P>

<P>e-commerce (SET transactions)</P>

<P>For applications with multiple banks involved:</P>

<P>electronic settlement with the Federal Bank (Bundesbank)</P>

<P>SWIFT</P>

<P>The <A href="hid_crypt_3des_cbc.html">Triple-DES algorithm</A> is the standard encryption algorithm used at the Deutsche Bank, while the <A href="hid_crypt_rsaenc.html">RSA algorithm</A> is standard for digital signatures. <A href="hid_crypt_hash_ripemd160.html">RIPEMD-160</A> is used as the standard <A href="hashfunktion.html">hash function</A>.</P>

<P>As well as the specific security requirements of different applications, there are often special requirements and/or restrictions relating to the use of encryption algorithms, so that additional procedures are used as well.</P>

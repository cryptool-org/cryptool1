		<h3>Dialog Prime Number Generation (Menu <a href="menu_related_methods.html">Individual 
				Procedures</a> \ RSA Cryptosystem)</h3>
		<P>You can access this dialog via the menu entry <a href="menu_related_methods.html">Individual 
				Procedures</a> \ <a href="menu_individualprocedures_rsacryptosystem.html">RSA Cryptosystem</a> \ <a href="hid_einzelverfahren_tutorial_primzahlengenerieren.html"> Generate prime numbers</a>.</P>
		
		<P>Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1, which are divisible only by 1 
			and by themselves, and in cryptography they play an important role. In this 
			demonstration you can generate prime numbers yourself, the prime numbers are 
			generated randomly within freely definable limits.</P>
		<P><IMG SRC="images/generatepz.gif" ALT="generatepz.gif" BORDER="0"></P>
		<P>If you press the <B>Generate prime numbers</B> button, a <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="hid_zufall_generatoren.html">random</A>
			search for the prime numbers p and q will be initiated. A number X will be 
			taken at random from the range specified [Lower limit, Upper limit]. The 
			system then "tests" whether X can be a prime number.</P>
		<p>For this test random is also necessary:</p>
		<UL>
			<LI>
				If X is not a prime number, then the chosen test states with a probability of ½ 
				that X is not a prime number, whereas in the other case the feedback is always 
				positive. If the prime number test is repeated 80 times "independently" and 
				always has a positive outcome, then the probability that X is not actually a 
				prime number is extremely small at 2^(-80) and the number thus found is 
				understood as a prime number, and is displayed as either prime number p or 
				prime number q.</LI>
			<LI>
				If one of k prime number test is negative, then X is not prime and the test is 
				repeated with a new randomly chosen number X.</LI>
		</UL>
		<P>In this dialog you can choose between the following prime number tests:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
				Miller-Rabin test,</LI>
			<LI>
				Solovay-Strassen test and</LI>
			<LI>
				Fermat test</LI>
		</UL>
		<P>If no prime number has been found after trying 1000 randomly drawn numbers X, 
			then an appropriate error message is displayed. In that case you need to raise 
			the range defined by the limits [Lower limit, Upper limit] for the prime numbers 
			accordingly.
		</P>
		<P>Detailed information on the subject of prime numbers will be found in the <A class="filelink" onclick="parser('script-en.pdf')">
				CT Book</A>.</P>
				
<P><B>Generation of all prime numbers in a specific value range</B></P>

<P>If the radio button <B>Generate all prime numbers in a value range</B> is checked, the dialog searches for 
all prime numbers within the value range specified for the prime number p. In contrast to the 
generation of only two prime numbers, the numbers are not randomly chosen from the value range. 
Instead, each number within the value range is tested one after another. Please note that this 
process can be very time consuming. However, you can interrupt this process using the emerging 
progress bar.</P>

<P>When the process is finished, all prime numbers that were found are dumped into a new document. 
You can configure the separator used to separate the prime numbers using the input field 
<b>Separator for the display of the primes</b>.</P>

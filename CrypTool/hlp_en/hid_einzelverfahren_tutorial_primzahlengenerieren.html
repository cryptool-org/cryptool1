<P><A NAME="hid_einzelverfahren_tutorial_primzahlengenerieren"></A><B>Dialogue Generate Prime Numbers (demonstration)</B></P>

<P>Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1, which are divisible only by 1 and by themselves, and in cryptography they play an important role. In this demonstration you can generate prime numbers yourself, the prime numbers being generated randomly within freely definable limits.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/generatepz.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>If you press the Generate prime numbers button, a <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="hid_zufall_generatoren.html">random</A> search for prime numbers for p and q will be initiated. A number X will be taken at a random from the range specified [Lower limit ... Upper limit]. The system then "tests" for X whether X can be a prime number. Once again, chance is used for this test:</P>

<P><!--ZZZINDN--></P>

<P>If X is not a prime number, then the chosen test states with a probability of ½ that X is not a prime number, whereas in the other case the message is always positive. If the prime number test is repeated 80 times "independently" and always has a positive outcome, then the probability that X is not actually a prime number is extremely small at 2^(-80) and the number thus found is interpreted as a prime number and is output as either prime number p or prime number q.</P>

<P></P>

<P>If one of k prime number test is negative, then X is not prime and the test is repeated with a new randomly chosen number X.</P>

<P><!--ZZZINDNE--></P>

<P>In this dialogue you can choose between the following prime number tests:</P>

<P><!--ZZZUL-->

<UL>
	<LI>Miller-Rabin Test,<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Solovay-Strassen Test and<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Fermat Test</LI>
</UL>

<P><!--ZZZULE--></P>

<P>If no prime number has been found after trying 1000 randomly drawn numbers X, then an appropriate error message is displayed. In that case you need to raise the permitted value limits [Lower limit ... Upper limit] for the prime numbers accordingly. </P>

<P>Detailed information on the subject of prime numbers will be found in the <!--ZZZLINK--><A href="script-en.pdf">script</A>.</P>

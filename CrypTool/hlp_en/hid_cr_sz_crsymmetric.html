<H3>Scenario Challenge-Response (symmetric)</H3>

<P>This scenario slightly updates the idea of one-time passwords. The improvement lies in the fact that current password can only be obtained during the time protocol is processed. It is rendered possible due to usage of a symmetric encryption method.</P>

<P>The protocol starts by Server 1 sending a random number to the client called challenge. The client encrypts this number with a secret key and returns the result as response to Server 1 who knows the secret key as well. It decodes the response and compares it with the challenge. When matched, the client’s identity is accepted and he is authenticated.</P>

<P>Excursion key exchange: If n parties (example with n=1000) want to communicate confidential and symmetric cryptography should be used in a way that each two communication partners use one common key, there need to be</P>

<P>½ * n * (n-1) </P>


<P>different keys. (With n = 1000, this would be 499500 different keys)</P>
<br>
<P>Would asymmetric cryptography be used, there needed to be</P>

<P>2 * n </P>

<P>keys. (With n = 1000, this would be 2000 different keys)</P>

<P>Because every station uses symmetric cryptography, Server 1, Server 2 and Client share the same symmetric key in that scenario to communicate confidential for reasons of efficiency. One of the possible solutions for this scenario aim to a connected problem with that characteristic.</P>

<P>Your task as attacker is, again, to find acceptance by Server 1 as Client. This time here are several solutions. If you fail to find one you can get one <A href="hid_cr_sol_crsymmetric.html">here</A>.</P>

<P>Challenge response method is in e.g. in cellular mobile networks (respectively GSM networks).</P>

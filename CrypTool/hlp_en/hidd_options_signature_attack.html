<P>First, one of six hash functions <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="hashfunktion.html">hash functions</A> can be chosen for the attack. The 128-bit hash functions MD2, MD4 and MD5 as well as the 160-bit hash functions SHA, SHA-1 and RIPEMD-160 are available.</P>

<P>The <B>Significant bit length</B> determines the number of the highest bits in the hash values that have to match so that the attack is considered successful. The co-domain of the significant bit length is 1 &lt;= x &lt;= n, with n being the bit length of the chosen hash function.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/ads_options.gif" ALT="ads_options.gif" BORDER=0></P>

<P>In the category <B>Options for the modification of messages</B> the method of modifying messages depending on the lastly computed hash value can be chosen.</P>

<P>If the radio button <B>Insert blanks</B> is checked, at least one of the two check boxes <B>In front of end of line</B> and <B>Double Blanks</B> has to be checked. Starting from the end of a message, a blank is inserted in front of an end of line and/or in front of another blank.</P>

<P><B>Attach characters</B> is the other method of modifying messages. There, two bits of a hash value are mapped on one character which is attached at the end of the message. For reasons of demonstration, <B>Printable characters</B> ("A", "B", "C" or "D") can be used, otherwise <B>Unprintable characters</B> (the characters with the ASCII codes 9, 10, 32 or 160) are attached.</P>

<P>With <B>Reset to standard</B> the settings are reset to:</P>

<P>If the attack was successful some statistical data about the attack will be displayed in the <B>Dialogue Statistics of the attack</B>.</P>

<P>The category <B>Efforts made to find a pair of messages</B> displays:</P>

<P><!--ZZZUL--></P>

<P>-The <B>Calculation time</B> broken down into years, days, hours, minutes and seconds.</P>

<P>-The number of <B>steps</B> that were required to find a pair of messages with the same hash value.</P>

<P>-The total number of <B>hash operations</B>.</P>

<P>-A list which breaks down each run on <B>Steps until collision</B>, <B>Check of the collision</B> and <B>Total steps</B>.</P>

<P><!--ZZZULE--></P>

<P>The category <B>Additional bytes</B> shows how many bytes were attached to the harmless and dangerous message so that the hash values of the resulting modifications collided. If the method <B>Attach characters</B> was chosen the number of attached bytes is the same for both messages, whereas using the method <B>Insert blanks</B> can result in a different number of attached bytes for each message.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/ads_statistics.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>By Clicking <B>Print statistics</B> all collected data is printed in a text file and another attack can be started in the dialogue <A href="hidd_signature_attack.html">Attack on the hash value of the digital signature</A>.</P>

<P>The same applies to clicking <B>Cancel</B> except that no text file is printed.</P>

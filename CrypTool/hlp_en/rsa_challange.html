<h3>Cipher Challenge</h3>

<P>A "challenge" is a cryptographic problem that has been published, sometimes with a prize offered for cracking it. </P>

<br>

<P>In less frequently cases challenges are published to underpin the resistance of an algorithm against cryptanalytical attacks.</P>

<P>When a challenge has not yet been cracked despite many attempts, then confidence in the propagated system rises. If someone succeeds in cracking the problem, then the cryptosystem with the specified parameters is no longer regarded as secure.</P>

<P>For the best-known asymmetric cryptosystem, the RSA system of Rivest, Shamir and Adleman, over 50 challenges had been published on the RSA website (<a href="http://www.rsa.com" target="_blank">www.rsa.com</a>).
<br>
See also <a href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_Factoring_Challenge" target="_blank">Wikipedia RSA_Factoring_Challenge</a>.</P>

<br>

<P>The most cipher challenges are published on grounds of an intellectual challenge, an exercise or as a kind of modern avocation. The line between mathematical and pure cipher challenges seems to be floating.</P>

<P>One of the most active and diversified contests of this kind is <a href="http://www.mysterytwisterc3.org" target="_blank">MysteryTwister C3</a>. This contest
also contains all till then unsolved challenges of the above mentioned RSA
factoring challenge.</P>

<h3>Passwords</h3>

<P>Here you get a comprehensive oveview on password theory. If you only want to get a feel for the 
security of your own password, then use the dialog 
<a href="hidd_passwordqualitymeter.html">Password Quality Meter</a>.</P>

<!--
<B><U>Password length, password space and password entropy</U></B>

<P>If you factor out inappropriate handling and storage of passwords, then the security of a password depends on the length of the password, the size of the password space and the entropy of the password.</P>

<P>The <B>length</B> of a password has a huge influence on its security. Short passwords can easily be guessed, so in turn a short password is a bad password. The longer a password, the better.</P>

<P>The <B>size</B> of the password space is the amount of passwords that can be created with all available characters (the alphabet). Assume you have an alphabet of 52 letters (upper- and lowercase) as well as ten digits, then the password space consists of 62^8, that is around 200 trillion passwords. If you increase the size of the alphabet with 10 more characters (for example special characters), the password space grows to more than three times of its size. The bigger the password space, the better.</P>

<P><a name="passwordentropy"></a>The password <B>entropy</B> indicates how "randomly" a password is chosen out of the given password space. Based on certain statistical assumptions you can exactly determine the <a href="entropie.html">entropy</a> of a password.</P>

<H3>Solution to Scenario One-Time Passwords</H3>

<P>A possible solution to this scenario is to tap the current password and disturb the protocol before server 1 receives the password. You proceed as follows:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>You create a connection between the attacker’s computer and router 1.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Attack router 1 (it must appear red now).<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Separate the connection between router 1 and router 2.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>You start the protocol from the client via the button <b>Authenticate client</b>. As soon as the data packet is transferred from router 1, a copy is forwarded to you so you can obtain the password. The disconnection between router 1 and router 2 prevents the proper protocol process which, therefore, has to be stopped. You and the client receive a notice “The protocol was interrupted”.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Now revoke the separation of router 1 and router 2 and then you can proceed with the protocol from the attacker’s computer with the still current password (from the server´s point of view) via the button <b> Authenticate attacker.</LI>
</OL>

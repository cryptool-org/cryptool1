<h3>Dialog Diffie-Hellman-Key Exchange successful</h3>

<P>Congratulations!</P>

<P>This dialog shows that a common key has been exchanged via the Diffie-Hellman protocol between Alice and Bob. If the Diffie-Hellman parmeter were secure, an eaveasdropper would not have the chance to read this key.</P>

<h3>Dialog Key Entry: ADFGVX </h3>

<P>You can reach this dialog via the menu entry <A href="menu_crypt.html">Encrypt/Decrypt</a> \ <a href="menu_crypt_symmetricclassic.html">Symmetric (classic)</a> \ <a href="HID_ENCRYPT_ADFGVX.html">ADFGVX</a>.</P>


<p>In this dialog, the key for the <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="hid_encrypt_adfgvx.html">ADFGVX encryption algorithm</A> is entered.</p>
<p>
Since ADFGVX is a two-step cascade cipher, the key consists of two parts: first the substitution key and secondly the transposition key (also called transposition password). Accordingly, the key entry dialog is divided into two sections.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Step 1: Substitution</b></p>
<p>
The <b>substitution matrix</b> is filled with each letter from 'A' to 'Z' and each digit from '0' to '9', other entries are not allowed. On repeated entry of an existing character, a dialog box is displayed, giving the user the possibility to erase the old entry or to undo the change.</p>
<p>The button <b>Standard matrix</b> fills the substitution matrix with all characters in order, the button <b>Random matrix</b> fills it with a random order of all characters. Clicking the button <b>Erase matrix</b> and confirming the pop-up-dialog will erase the substitution matrix. This is a comfortable way to enter examples from literature or other sources.</p>
<p>The button <b>Enter string</b> allows to enter the characters of the substitution matrix as a string (if the string does not contain all alphabet characters then the remaining ones are filled up alphabetically). This is helpful if you want to reproduce samples from the literature.</p>


<p><b>Step 2: Transposition</b></p>
<p>
The text field <b>Transposition password</b> can contain any string of characters. Redundant or invalid characters will be removed before de- or encryption. Below the text field, the current sequence of the transposition columns is displayed.</p>


<br><p>Clicking on the icon
<IMG SRC="images/iconinsertkey.gif" ALT="iconinsertkey.gif" BORDER=0> <b>Insert key</b>
inserts an ADFGVX key that was previously copied 
to the <a href="keystore.html">internal key storage</a> (if the button is 
inactive/gray, there is no ADFGVX key available).</p>


<p><b>Output options</b></p>
<p>
By checking the box <b>Separate output blocks by blanks</b> and entering a value in the according input field for <b>block length</b>, it is possible to display the ciphertext in groups of 1 to 26 characters. The default value "5" is determined by the historical circumstances: During WW1 the ADFGVX code was transmitted via morse code; the morse signals were sent in groups of five letters.<br>
The check box <b>New line after each block</b> starts a new line of text after each group of letters.</p>
<p>
The box <b>Print out intermediate result</b> causes the non-permutated but substituted text to be written to a separate document window. This output can be formatted in the same way as the final ciphertext. By default, the block length is adjusted to the transposition password length.</p>
<p>
To enhance the readability of the ADFGVX-bigrams in step 1, a grouping of two letters is recommended. If you want a better understanding of the column transposition, you should set the grouping of both steps to the current password length and activate the <i>new line</i> option of step 1. You will discover that the text of step 1 read by columns from top to bottom is identical to the final ciphertext read by the line.</p>
<p>
If both parts of the ADFGVX key are entered correctly, the button <b>Encrypt</b> is activated. You can now encrypt the document with the ADFGVX encoding method.<br>If the document is already an ADFGVX encrypted text, the button <b>Decrypt</b> is activated as well and you can decipher the message.</p>

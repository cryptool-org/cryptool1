<h3><P><A NAME="hidd_adfgvx"></A><B>Dialog key input ADFGVX-Cipher (Menu <a href="menu_crypt.hml">Crypt/Decrypt</a> \ Symmetric (classic))</B></P></h3>

<p>In this dialog window, the key for the <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="hid_adfgvx.html">ADFGVX encoding method</A> is entered.<br>
<br>
Since ADFGVX is a two-stage cascade cipher, the key consists of two parts: the substitution key and the transposition key. Accordingly, the key input dialog window is divided into two sections.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img border="0" src="images/adfgvx_key.gif" width="401" height="648"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Stage 1: substitution</b><br>
<br>
The <b>substitution matrix</b> is filled with each letter from 'A' to 'Z' and each cipher from '0' to '9', other entries are not allowed. On repeated entry of an existing character, a dialog box is displayed, giving the user the possibility to erase the old entry or to undo the change. The button <b>Standard matrix</b> fills the substitution matrix with all characters in order, the button <b>Random matrix</b> fills it with a random order of all characters. Clicking the button <b>Clear matrix</b> and confirming the pop-up-dialog will erase the substitution matrix. This is a comfortable way to enter examples from literature or other sources.<br>
<br>

<b>Stage 2: transposition</b><br>
<br>
The text field <b>Transposition password</b> can contain any string of characters. Redundant or invalid characters will be removed before de- or encryption. Below the text field, the current sequence for the column transposition is displayed.<br>
<br>
<b>Output options</b><br>
<br>
By checking the box <b>Separate text by blanks</b> and entering a value in the adjoining input field, it is possible to display the ciphertext in groups of 1 to 26 characters. The default value "5" is determined by the historical circumstances: during the Great War the ADFGVX-code was transmitted via morse code; the morse signals were sent in groups of five letters.<br>
The check box <b>Additional line feed after each block</b> starts a new line of text after each group of letters.<br>
<br>
The box <b>Output stage 1</b> causes the unpermutated but substituted text to be written to a separate document. This output can be formatted in the same ways as the final ciphertext. By default, the block length is adjusted to the transposition password length<br><br>
To enhance the readablility of the ADFGVX-bigrams in stage 1, a grouping of two letters is advisable. If you want a better understanding of the column transposition, you should set the grouping of both stages to the current password length and activate the <i>new line</i> option of stage 1. You will discover that the text of stage 1 read by columns from top to bottom is identical to the final ciphertext read by the line.<br>
<br>
If both parts of the ADFGVX key are entered correctly, the button <b>Encrypt</b> is activated. You can now encrypt the document with the ADFGVX encoding method.<br>If the document is already an ADFGVX-encrypted text, the button <b>Decrypt</b> is activated as well and you can decipher the message.<br>
<br>
Clicking the <b>key icon</b> inserts an ADFGVX key that was previously copied to the key memory (if the button is inactive, there is no ADFGVX key available).<br>

		<h3>Dialog Key Monoalphabetic Substitution / Atbash</h3>
		<P>You can reach this dialog via the menu entry <A href="menu_crypt.html">Encrypt/Decrypt</A> \ <a href="menu_crypt_symmetricclassic.html">Symmetric(classic)</a> \ <a href="HID_CryptMono.html">Substitution/Atbash</a>.</P>

		<P>This dialog is used to enter the <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="schluessel.html">key</A>
			for <A href="hid_cryptmono.html">monoalphabetic substitution</A>.</P>
		<P>When entering the key the following points should be noted:
		</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			The dialog only accepts the 26 letters. All other inputs are automatically 
			rejected, i.e. they are not displayed.
			<LI>
				No distinction is made between upper and lower case letters, i.e. lower case 
				letters are converted to upper case.
			</LI>
		</UL>
		<P>There are two ways of entering the key:
		</P>
		<OL>
			<LI>
				You can enter the desired permutation (an arrangement of all 26 letters in the 
				alphabet) directly.<br>
			</LI>
			<ul type="circle">
				<LI>
					In this case a text 26 characters long should be entered. The letter A will 
					then be mapped to the first latter of the text that is entered, the B to the 
					second, and so on. Care should be taken here to ensure that no letter occurs 
					twice in the text input.</LI></ul>
			<br>
			<LI>
				However, you can also enter a keyword from which the permutation is derived. An 
				example here might be the keyword "RAILWAYS". The resulting permutation is 
				worked out as follows. The A is mapped to the first letter (in this case the 
				R). Similarly, the B is mapped to A, the C to I, the D to L and the E to W. As 
				the sixth letter of the keyword, the A, has already occurred it is passed over, 
				since no two (different) letters can be mapped to the same letter. This 
				continues until all the letters in the keyword have been mapped, i.e. F to Y 
				and G to S. All the other letters (H to Z) are mapped to the letters that have 
				not yet been used in reverse sequence, i.e. H to Z, I to Y, .... Z to C.</LI></OL>
		<P>After you have entered the key, you can encrypt the document by clicking on the <B>Encrypt</B>
			button or decrypt the document by selecting <B>Decrypt</B>.</P>
		<P>The formatting (retention of the spaces, special characters and upper and lower 
			case distinction) of the output of the encrypted or decrypted document can be 
			set in the <A href="hid_opttext.html">Text Options</A> dialog.</P>

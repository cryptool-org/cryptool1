<H3><P><B>Card deck (deck)</B></P></H3>

<P>The card deck (deck) is a card game with a defined number of cards and possible modifications with added jokers or added marks.<br><br>
<a href="HID_SYMCLASSIC_SOLITAIRE.html">Solitaire</a> uses in general a bridge suit with 52 cards plus two added jokers. The jokers have to be differenciated each other (joker A and joker B).<br><br>
Each of the 54 cards at <a href="HID_SYMCLASSIC_SOLITAIRE.html">Solitaire</a> represents a value (card value):<br>

<br>
Club ace = 1<br>
Club 2   = 2<br>
Club 3   = 3<br>
Club 4   = 4<br>
Club 5   = 5<br>
Club 6   = 6<br>
Club 7   = 7<br>
Club 8   = 8<br>
Club 9       = 9<br>
Club 10      = 10<br>
Club jack    = 11<br>
Club queen    = 12<br>
Club king = 13<br><br>
Diamond ace = 14<br>
Diamond 2  = 15<br>
Diamond 3  = 16<br>
...<br>
Diamond king = 26<br><br>
Heart ace = 27<br>
Heart 2  = 28<br>
Heart 3  = 29<br>
...<br>
Heart king = 39<br><br>
Spade ace = 40<br>
Spade 2 = 41<br>
Spade 3  = 42<br>
...<br>
Spade king = 52<br><br>
Joker A = 53<br>
Joker B = 53 <br><br>

Because of step 1 and step 2 of the <a href="HID_SYMCLASSIC_SOLITAIRE.html">Solitaire algorithm</a>, the jokers have to differenciate each other.<br>
If less than 54 cards are in use, the card values have to be adapted. Joker A and B may not be missing and get the card value, which results in number of cards minus one (for 54 cards, the card value of both jokers is 54 minus one (53)).<br> The minimum of the number of cards is three, because a card deck which consists only of two jokers cannot generate a keystream letter.

<H4><P><B>Initial deck</B></P></H4>

<p>The initial deck at the <a href="HID_SYMCLASSIC_SOLITAIRE.html">Solitaire algorithm</a> represents the (already shuffled) beginning order of cards. It represents the state of the card deck before the algorithm to generate the keystream is used the first time. The initial deck is needed of both agents (sender and receiver), to generate an equal <a href="schluessel.html">keystream</a>.</p>

<H4><P><B>Final deck</B></P></H4>

<p>The final deck represents at the <a href="HID_SYMCLASSIC_SOLITAIRE.html">Solitaire algorithm</a> the ending order of cards. It represents the state of the card deck directly after generating the last keystream letter.<br>
Usually the final deck  is "deleted" (new shuffle) by the sender and the receiver after the generation of the <a href="schluessel.html">keystream</a>. This final deck can be saved, because the implemented <a  href="HID_ANALYSE_SYMMCLASSIC_CIPHERTEXTOLY_SOLITAIRE.html">Solitaire cryptanalysis</a> needs the ciphertext as well as the final deck.</p>

<h3><P><A NAME="hid_aes_selfextract"></A><B>Dialogue AES (self-extracting) (Menu <a href="menu_crypt.html">Crypt/Decrypt</a> \ Symmetric (classic))</B></P></h3>

<P>Included in the package CrypTool is the separate encryption utility AES-Tool. Using this tool it is possible to convert documents into self-extracting archives. These archives are encrypted using the AES algorithm (Rijndael).</P>

<P>If this option is selected the main window of AES-Tool is opened. Here the key can be entered in hexadecimal form and the output file can be specified. Two different formats can be selected: encrypted file and self-extracting archive. For an encrypted file the receiver also need AES-Tool. For a self-extracting archive the complete executable is included in the archive. This results in a significantly increased size of the archive.</P>

<P>AES-Tool is used to exchange encrypted data with other users. It does not contain functions for key management. The keys have to be exchanged between the users on a secure channel.</P>

<P>AES-Tool also can be used independently of CrypTool. AES-Tool is governed by <A href="hidd_tipps_and_tricks.html#licence_terms">the same terms of licence and the exclusion of any kind of liability</A> as the CrypTool package.</P>

<P><B>Remark 1</B>:</P>

<P>Documents encrypted using the AES-Tool <B>cannot</B> be decrypted via the <A href="menu_crypt.html">Crypt/Decrypt</A> \ Symmetric \ <A href="hid_crypt_aes_rijndael.html">Rijndael</A> menu.</P>

<P>Accordingly documents encrypted using CrypTool via the <A href="menu_crypt.html">Crypt/Decrypt</A> \ Symmetric \ <A href="hid_crypt_aes_rijndael.html">Rijndael</A> menu cannot be decrypted with the AES-Tool.</P>

<P><B>Remark 2</B>:</P>

<P>When AES-Tool is started via the CrypTool menu option <A href="menu_crypt.html">Crypt/Decrypt</A> \ AES (self extracting), the field <B>Input file</B> will be filled with a path of the following form: C:\TEMP\cry7.org (C:\TEMP results from the environment variable TEMP and another number can be displayed than 7). This file is a copy of the file currently opened in CrypTool. It contains all manual modifications to that file, even if they have not yet been saved.</P>

<P><B>Remark 3</B>:</P>

<P>The Rijndael <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="verschlverfahren.html">encryption algorithm</A> works with a block length of 128 bits, and a variable key length e.g. 128, 192 and 256 bits. The input key will be filled with hex-zero characters up to the next minimal key length of 128, 196 resp. 256 bits.</P>

<P>Note that too short key lengths are considered as a security risk (see dialogue <A href="hidd_key.html">Key Input</A>). </P>

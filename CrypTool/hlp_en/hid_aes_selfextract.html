<h3>AES (self-extracting) (Menu <a href="menu_crypt.html">Encrypt/Decrypt</a> \ Symmetric Encryption (modern))</h3>

<P>Included in the package CrypTool is the separate encryption utility <B>AES-Tool</B>. Using this tool it is possible to convert documents into self-extracting archives. These archives are encrypted using the AES algorithm (Rijndael) in CBC mode.</P>

<P>If this option is selected the main window of AES-Tool is opened.</P>

<img src="images/aesscreenshot.gif" alt="aesscreenshot.gif">

<P>The functionality of AES-Tool is divided into three areas:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The <B>Key</B> group box: Here you can enter the key. Depending on the <I>Show entered key</I> check box, the key is either shown or hidden. The <I>Enter key as hex</I> check box controls whether the key is entered in hexadecimal or text form.</LI>
<LI>The <B>Input file</B> group box: Here you can enter the file to be encrypted. If the check box <I>Securely delete input file after encryption</I> is checked, the input file is irreversibly deleted. Please note: Depending on the size of the file to be encrypted, activating this option may take a lot of time as the contents of the input file is overwritten multiple times before actually being deleted.</LI>
<LI>The <B>Output format</B> Here you can choose between two formats for the output file: <I>Self-extracting and encrypted</I> or <I>Encrypted</I>. For a self-extracting and ecrypted file the complete AES-Tool executable is included in the archive, so this may result in a significantly increased size of the archive compared to the encrypted file. While an encrypted file (without the executable overhead) is smaller than a self-extracting archive, the receiver also needs AES-Tool to decrypt the file.</LI>
</UL>

<P>AES-Tool is used to exchange encrypted data with other users. It does not contain functions for <a href="schluessel.html">key</a> management. The keys have to be exchanged between the users on a secure channel.</P>

<P>AES-Tool also can be used independently of CrypTool. AES-Tool is governed by <A href="hidd_tipps_and_tricks.html#licence_terms">the same terms of licence and the exclusion of any kind of liability</A> as the CrypTool package.</P>

<P><B>Remark 1</B>:</P>

<P>Documents encrypted using AES-Tool <B>cannot</B> be decrypted via the <A href="menu_crypt.html">Encrypt/Decrypt</A> \ Symmetric \ <A href="hid_crypt_aes_rijndael.html">Rijndael</A> menu. Accordingly, documents encrypted using CrypTool via the <A href="menu_crypt.html">Encrypt/Decrypt</A> \ Symmetric \ <A href="hid_crypt_aes_rijndael.html">Rijndael</A> menu cannot be decrypted with AES-Tool. That is because CrypTool and AES-Tool use different file formats: Files encrypted with AES-Tool may contain extra information in addition to the payload, i.e. the code for the embedded executable.</P>

<P><B>Remark 2</B>:</P>

<P>When AES-Tool is started via the CrypTool menu option <A href="menu_crypt.html">Encrypt/Decrypt</A> \ AES (self extracting), the field <B>Input file</B> will be filled with a path of the following form: C:\TEMP\cry7.org (C:\TEMP results from the environment variable TEMP and another number can be displayed than 7). This file is a copy of the file currently opened in CrypTool. It contains all manual modifications to that file, even if they have not yet been saved.</P>

<P><B>Remark 3</B>:</P>

<P>The Rijndael <!--ZZZPOPUP--><A href="verschluesselung.html">encryption algorithm</A> works with a block length of 128 bits, and a variable key length e.g. 128, 192 and 256 bits. The input key will be filled with hex-zero characters up to the next minimal key length of 128, 196 resp. 256 bits.</P>

<P>Note that too short key lengths are considered as a security risk (see dialog <A href="hidd_key.html">Key Input</A>). </P>

<P><B>Remark 4</B>:</P>

<P>AES-Tool version 2.3 was successfully tested as standalone program with files up to 4 GB length.</P>

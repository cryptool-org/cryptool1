<h3>Dialog Factoring with a Hint</h3>

<P>You can reach this dialog via the menu entry 
<A href="menu_related_methods.html">Individual Procedures</A> \ 
<A href="menu_individualprocedures_rsacryptosystem.html">RSA Cryptosystem</A> \ 
<A href="menu_individualprocedures_rsacryptosystem_latticebasedattacks.html">Lattice Based Attacks on RSA</A> \ <a href="HID_RSA_FACTORHINT.html">Factoring with a Hint</a>.</P>

<p>The dialog <a href="hid_rsa_factorhint.html">Factoring-with-a-Hint</a> offers 
  two different modes, which can be chosen in the upper part of the window:<br>
  1. Enter the RSA-modulus <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>N</strong></font>, 
  the bit length of<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong> p</strong></font> 
  and the known part <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>P</strong></font> 
  can be entered manually.<br>
  2. Enter the bit length of N and of <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>p</strong></font> 
  and let the program generate a random example.</p>
<p align="center"> <img src="images/RSA_Factor_Hint_EN.gif" width="654" height="687" align="middle"></p>
<strong>Steps to proceed:</strong> 
<ol>
  <li>Depending on the above mentioned choice either <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong> 
    N </strong></font> itself or the bit length of <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong> 
    N </strong></font> can be entered.<br>
    The group <em>&quot;Base of numbers&quot;</em> allows to change the representation 
    of <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong> N</strong></font>,<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong> 
    p</strong></font> and <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>P</strong></font>.</li>
  <li> In both cases the bit length of <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>p 
    </strong></font> has to be entered (for this attack the bit length of <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong> 
    p</strong></font> has to be exactly known!). </li>
  <li>Consequently it is selected, whether the upper most significant or least 
    significant bits of <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>p</strong></font> 
    are known.</li>
  <li>Depending on the chosen mode either the known <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"></font> 
    part <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>P</strong></font> 
    of<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong> p</strong></font> is 
    entered manually or <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>P</strong></font> 
    is generated by entering the number of bits known and clicking &quot;Generate 
    example&quot;. <br>
    <strong>Note:</strong><br>
    When entering<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong> P </strong></font>manually 
    it has to be identical with<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong> 
    p</strong></font> in its binary representation in e.g. 40 bits. If you choose 
    option 1 you may want to change to the binary or hexadecimal representation 
    every once in a while to check, whether the bits are indentical!</li>
  <li>The attack is started by clicking the &quot;Start&quot; button.</li>
</ol>
<p>The section &quot;Attack&quot; provides information about the elapsed time 
  of the running attack and how many lattice reductions have been completed. After 
  the attack is finished, the found factors <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>p</strong></font> 
  and <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>q</strong></font> are 
  displayed. Furthermore the number of required bits (<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>n 
  / 4+1</strong></font>), which is calculated depending on <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>N</strong></font>, 
  is shown. From the number of known bits also follows the size of the latticebase: 
  the more bits of one of the factors are known, the smaller the lattice can be.</p>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<p>Proceed according to option 1:</p>
<p>Attack on a RSA modulus <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>N</strong></font> 
  with a length of 200 bits:</p>
<ol>
  <li> The attacker enters the publicly known value for <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>N</strong></font>:<br>
    <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>N = 1100928820568180272388944445745883306779673638843521865435523</strong></font></li>
  <li> In most of the cases both factors have exactly half the length of <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>N</strong></font>. 
    The same holds here:<br>
    Bit length of <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>p</strong></font>: 
    <strong>100</strong></li>
  <li> The attacker selects, that the upper most significant bits of <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>p</strong></font> 
    are known.</li>
  <li> He enters <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>P = 831311796601422049670156</strong></font>. 
  </li>
  <li>The attack is started by clicking <em>&quot;Start&quot;</em>.</li></ol>

<h4>Annotations: </h4>
<ol>
  <li>How much of the factor <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>p</strong></font> 
    of <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>N</strong></font> has 
    to be known does not depend on the size of<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong> 
    p</strong></font> but on the size of <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>N</strong></font>. 
    To be able to determine <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>N 
    </strong></font> of a bit length of n, at least<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong> 
    (n/4) +1</strong></font> bit have to be known, but this results in a lattice 
    the size of <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>n</strong></font>, 
    which is hard to solve from a size of <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>n=128</strong></font>.</li>
  <li>When <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>P</strong></font> 
    and <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>p</strong></font> match 
    in either their decimal or hexadecimal representation they rarely match exactly 
    in their binary representation. An attack, however, can only succeed if they 
    exactly match binary. <br>

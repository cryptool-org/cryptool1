<h3>Cascading cipher</h3>

<P>A cascading cipher (cascade) consists of several building blocks which are more primitive ciphers. A cascade is a combination of different ciphers, performed sequentially.</P>

<P>The easiest ones are only a repetition of the same concept (e.g. mono-alphabetic substitution). To make ciphers more secure combinations of substitution followed by transposition have been built (see <a href="hid_encrypt_adfgvx.html">ADFGVX encryption</a>).</P>

<P>All modern ciphers consist of more primitive building blocks.</P>

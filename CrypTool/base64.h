/* ---ENCODE---
 * Reads in binary (8 bit) input data in _in of size inlen and encodes 
 * it as base64 storing the result in _out of size outlen. 
 * You may set lwidth to something non-zero to make Base64Encode() 
 * insert newlines every lwidth*4 chars. (lwidth=1 -> every 4 chars; 
 * lwidth=0 -> disable this feature)
 * If state is non-NULL state info is updated. 
 * State info (carry) is needed only if you have a large amount of 
 * 8bit data which cannot be encoded in one single call. 
 * To do this, set up the u_int32_t state value to zero and pass a 
 * pointer to it whenever calling Base64Encode(). The function will 
 * store non-encoded bytes (max. 2 bytes + 2 bit counter) in state 
 * to be able to process them the next time unless you call 
 * Base64Encode() with inlen=0 to tell it that this is the end of the 
 * input data. (state will be 0 after that but better relay on the 
 * return values for error diagnosis.) 
 * When reaching input data end (either state!=NULL and inlen=0 or 
 * state=NULL), the base64 termination char `=' is appended to the 
 * output. 
 * Note: the current byte quartett count is also stored in state as 
 *   14 bit value so that the base64 text stays formatted even if you 
 *   have to call Base64Encode() repeatedly. So, you don't try to 
 *   set lwidth to values >2^14 (that is 2^14*4=65536 chars per line). 
 * 
 * Return value: 
 *  >=0 -> number of bytes in output
 *   -4 -> output buffer too small

 * stores the decoded result in buffer _out of size outlen. 
 * If state is non-NULL state info is updated. 
 * State info (carry) is needed only if you have a large amount of 
 * base64 data which cannot be decoded in one single call. 
 * To do this, set up the u_int32_t state value to zero and pass a

 * store non-decoded chars (max. 18 bits + 2 bit counter) in state 
 * to be able to process them the next time unless 
 *  - the base64 termination char (`=') is encountered or
 *  - you call Base64Decode() with inlen=0 which does just the same 
 *    as if you merely pass "=" as input. 
 * (state will be 0 after reading `=' / when passig inlen=0 but 
 *  better relay on the return values for error diagnosis.)
 * Return value: 
 *	  0 -> correct decoding
 *   -2 -> illegal char in input
 *   -3 -> premature end (only if state is NULL or base64 termination 
 *         char `=' is encountered too early)
 *   -4 -> output buffer too small

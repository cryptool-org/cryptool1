# PURPOSE OF THIS FILE
#
# This file introduces some redundancy by storing the popup menu ids,
# which are generated automatically during run-time when a user presses
# F1 while a menu with sub menu is selected. Those popup menu ids (pmenuids)
# must be present in the online help source (*.rtf) as A-footnotes (similar 
# to K-footnotes that are used to introduce key words, see help compiler 
# online help for details). 
#
# The redundancy was introduced to aid in maintaining the menus consitent 
# with the online help: whenever someone adds/changes/removes a menu entry
# with sub menu, this change is detected during compile time and an error is 
# flagged (s. below for possible errors). This is done to make people aware 
# that the online help has to be updated manually (drawback: this file also
# has to be updated manually).
#
# BACKGOUND
# 
# F1 does not work in MFC for menus with sub menus. This is because the 
# ressource file syntax for popup menus does not include the ID that is used
# for all other menu items. This ID is normally used to invoke the online
# help topic corresponding to a menu item. To make F1 work on menu items 
# with sub menus we generated a new identifier derived from the menu label.
#
# FILE FORMAT
#
# lines starting with # are ignored. 
# for each menu with sub menu (called popup menu in *.rc) there must 
# exist a line of the following form:
#
# language[white space]pmenuid[white space]# menu labels from ressources
#
# where
# - language is ENGLISH or GERMAN
# - pmenuid is derived from the menu labels up to the root by removing all
#		non alphanumerical characters and appending the labels separated by _ 
# - #... has the unmodified menue lables separated by | for reference
#
# ERROR MESSAGES
# error: CrypTool.rc:line#: This menu entry is the same as an earlier one (<menu label sequence>) except for non alpha-numerical characters. Both will be treated the same w.r.t. F1
#	this flags inconsistency between two copies of a menu item. Possible reason: inconsitent keyboard accelerators
# error: CrypToolPopupMenuIDs.txt:line#: Menu text was changed in CrypTool.rc:line#? Please update CrypToolPopupMenuIDs.txt to # <menu label sequence>
#   this means in most cases that a menu entry was changed in the resources, 
#	so that online help and this files have to be updated
# error: CrypToolPopupMenuIDs.txt:line#: Popup menu deleted from CrypTool.rc? Please check and possibly delete this line
#	this means in most cases that a menu entry was deleted from the resources,
#	so that the online help and this file have to be updated
# error: CrypTool.rc:line#: New menu entry? Please update CrypToolPopupMenuIDs.txt: <language> <pmenuid> # <menu label sequence>
#	this means in most cases that a new menu entry was introduced,
#	so that the online help and this file have to be updated

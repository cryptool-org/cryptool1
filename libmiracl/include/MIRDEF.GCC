 *   This version is suitable for use with the GCC compiler
 *   in a C/C++ only unix environment.
 *   Remove mrmuldv.c from the build, and add in mrkcm.c 
 *
 *   For MS C on a PC, change BIG_ENDIAN to LITTLE_ENDIAN
 *   and "long long" to "__int64"
 *
 *   Assembly language routines for the mrmuldv module will 
 *   probably speed things up, so in most cases the generic 
 *   mirdef.h32 file is appropriate
 *
 *   NOT recommended for Linux on PCs - read first.doc
 *
 *   NOTE:- Read comments in miracl.mak unix make file

\index{Prime number} \index{Number!prime}
Prime numbers are whole, positive numbers greater than or equal to $2$ that can
only be divided by 1 and themselves. All other natural numbers greater than or
equal to $2$ can be formed by multiplying prime numbers.

The {\em natural} \index{Number!natural} numbers $\mathbb{N}=\{1, 2, 3, 4,\cdots \}$ thus comprise 
\begin{itemize}
   \item the number $1$ (the unit value)
   \item the primes and
   \item the composite numbers.
\end{itemize}

Prime numbers are particularly important for 3 reasons:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In number theory, they are considered to be the basic components of
natural numbers, upon which numerous brilliant mathematical ideas are based.
  \item They are of extreme practical importance in modern
\index{Cryptography!modern} cryptography (public key \index{Cryptography!public key} cryptography). The most common public key procedure, invented at the end of
the 1970's, is \index{RSA} RSA encryption. Only using (large) prime numbers for
particular parameters can you guarantee that an algorithm is secure, both for
the RSA procedure and for even more modern procedures (digital
\index{Signatures!digital} signature, elliptic curves).
  \item The search for the largest known prime numbers does not have any
practical usage known to date, but requires the best computers, is an excellent
benchmark (possibility for determining the performance\index{Performance} of computers) and leads
to new calculation methods on many computers \\ (see also:
\href{http://www.mersenne.org/prime.htm}{\tt
http://www.mersenne.org/prime.htm}).
\end{itemize}
Many people have been fascinated by prime numbers over the past two millenniums.
Ambition to make new discoveries about prime numbers has often resulted in
brilliant ideas and conclusions. The following section provides an easily
comprehensible introduction to the basics of prime numbers. We will also explain
what is known about the distribution (density, number of prime numbers in
particular intervals) of prime numbers and how prime number tests work.

\subsection{Prime numbers in mathematics}

Every whole number has a factor. The number 1 only has one factor,
itself, whereas the number $12$ has the six factors $1, 2, 3, 4,
6, 12$. Many numbers can only be divided by themselves and by $1$.
With respect to multiplication, these are the ``atoms'' in the
area of numbers. Such numbers are called prime numbers.

In mathematics, a slightly different (but equivalent) definition is used.

\begin{definition}\label{def-pz-prime}
A whole number $p \in {\bf N}$ is called prime \index{Number!prime} if
$p > 1$ and $p$ only possesses the trivial factors $\pm 1$ and $\pm p$.
\end{definition}


By definition, the number $1$ is not a prime number. In the following sections,
$p$ will always denote a prime number.

The sequence of prime numbers starts with $$ 2,~ 3,~ 5,~ 7, ~ 11, ~ 13, ~
17, ~ 19, ~ 23, ~ 29, ~ 31, ~ 37, ~ 41, ~ 43, ~ 47, ~ 53, ~ 59, ~ 61,
~ 67, ~ 71, ~ 73, ~ 79, ~ 83, ~ 89, ~ 97, \cdots . $$
The first 100 numbers include precisely 25 prime numbers. After this, the percentage of primes
constantly decreases. Prime numbers can be factorised in a unique {\em trivial}
way: $$5 = 1 \cdot 5,\quad  17 = 1 \cdot 17, \quad 1,013 = 1 \cdot 1,013,  \quad
1,296,409 = 1 \cdot 1,296,409.$$
All numbers that have $2$ or more factors are called \index{Number!composite}
{\em composite}. These include $$ 4 = 2 \cdot 2, \quad 6 = 2\cdot 3 $$ as well
as numbers that {\em look like primes}, but are in fact composite:
$$ 91 = 7 \cdot 13, \quad 161=7 \cdot 23, \quad 767 =13 \cdot 59. $$

\begin{theorem}\label{thm-pz-sqr}
Each whole number $m$ greater than $1$ possesses a lowest factor greater than
$1$. This is a prime number $p$. Unless $m$ is a prime number itself, then: $p$
is less than or equal to the square root of $m$.
\end{theorem}

All whole numbers greater than $1$ can be expressed as a product of prime
numbers --- in a unique way. This is the claim of the 1st fundamental theorem of
number theory (= fundamental theorem of arithmetic = fundamental building block
of all positive integers).\index{Number theory!fundamental theorem}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm-pz-prod}
Each element $n$ of the natural numbers greater than $1$ can be written as the
product $n = p_1 \cdot p_2 \dots p_m$ of prime numbers. If two such
factorisations $$n =  p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdots p_m = p'_1 \cdot p'_2 \cdots
p'_{m'}$$ are given, then they can be reordered such that $\;m = m'\;$ and for
all $i$:  $\;p_i = p'_i$.
\end{theorem}

In other words: each natural number other than $1$ can be written as a product
of prime numbers in precisely one way, if we ignore the order of the factors.
The factors are therefore unique (the {\em expression as a product of factors}
is unique)! For example, $$ 60 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 2^2\cdot 3^1 \cdot
5^1. $$
And this --- other than changing the order of the factors --- is the only way in
which the number $60$ can be factorised. If you allow numbers other than primes
as factors, there are several ways of factorising integers and the uniqueness \hypertarget{uniqueness}{} is
lost: $$ 60 = 1 \cdot 60 = 2 \cdot 30 = 4 \cdot 15 = 5 \cdot 12 =6 \cdot 10 = 2
\cdot 3 \cdot 10 = 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = \cdots . $$

The following section is aimed more at those familiar with mathematical logic:
The 1st fundamental theorem only appears to be obvious \label{remFundTheoOfArithm}. We can construct
numerous other sets of numbers (i.e. other than positive whole numbers greater
than 1), for which numbers in the set cannot be expressed uniquely as a product
of the prime numbers of the set: In the set $M = \{1, 5, 10, 15, 20, \cdots\}$
there is no equivalent to the fundamental theorem under multiplication. The
first five prime numbers of this sequence are $5, 10, 15, 20, 30$ (note: $10$ is
prime, because $5$ is not a factor of $10$ in this set --- the result is not an
element of the given basic set $M$). Because the following applies in $M$: $$
100 = 5 \cdot 20 = 10 \cdot 10 $$ and $5, 10, 20$ are all prime numbers in this
set, the expression as a product of prime factors is not unique here.

\subsection{How many prime numbers are there?}

For the natural numbers, the primes can be compared to elements in chemistry or
the elementary particles in physics (see \cite[p. 22]{Blum1999}).

Although there are only $92$ natural chemical elements, the number of prime
numbers is unlimited. Even the Greek, \index{Euclid} Euclid\footnote{Euclid,
a Greek mathematician of 4th and 3rd century before Christ. He worked at the
egyptian academy of Alexandria and wrote ``The Elements'', the most well known systematical textbook
of the Greek mathematics.} knew this in the
third century before Christ.
\begin{theorem}[Euclid]\label{thm-pz-euklid}\footnote{The common usage of the term does not denote Euclid as the inventor of the theorem rather;
the true inventor is merely not as prominent. The theorem has already been distinguished
and proven in Euclid’s Elements (Book IX, s. 20). The phraseology is remarkable due to 
the fact that the word infinite is not used. The text reads as following
$$
O\acute{\iota}~\pi\varrho\tilde{\omega}\tau o \iota~\grave{\alpha}\varrho\iota\vartheta\mu o\grave{\iota}~
\pi\lambda\varepsilon\acute{\iota}o \upsilon\varsigma~\varepsilon\grave{\iota}\sigma\grave{\iota}~
\pi\alpha\nu\tau\grave{o}\varsigma~\tau o \tilde{\upsilon}~
\pi\varrho o \tau\varepsilon\vartheta\acute{\varepsilon}\nu\tau o \varsigma~
\pi\lambda\acute{\eta}\vartheta\ o \upsilon\varsigma~
\pi\varrho\acute{\omega}\tau\omega\nu~
\grave{\alpha}\varrho\iota\vartheta\mu\tilde{\omega}\nu,
$$
the English translation of which is: the prime numbers are more than any previously existing amount
of prime numbers.}
The sequence of prime numbers does not discontinue.
Therefore, the quantity of prime numbers is infinite.
\end{theorem}
His proof that there is an infinite number of
primes is still considered to be a brilliant mathematical consideration and
conclusion today (proof by contradiction). He assumed that there is only a
finite number of primes and therefore a largest prime number. Based on this
assumption, he drew logical conclusions until he obtained an obvious
contradiction. This meant that something must be wrong. As there were no
mistakes in the chain of conclusions, it could only be the assumption that was
wrong. Therefore, there must be an infinite number of primes!

\hypertarget{euclid}{}
\paragraph{Euclid's proof by contradiction} argues as follows:

{\bf Assumption:} \quad There is a {\em finite} number of primes. \\*[4pt] {\bf
Conclusion:} \quad Then these can be listed $p_1 < p_2 < p_3 < \dots < p_n$,
where $n$ is the (finite) number of prime numbers. $p_n$ is therefore the
largest prime. Euclid now looks at the number $a = p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdots p_n +1$.
This number cannot be a prime number because it is not included in our list of
primes. It must therefore be divisible by a prime, i.e. there is a natural
number $i$ between $1$ and $n$, such that $p_i$ divides the number $a$. Of
course, $p_i$ also divides the product $a-1 = p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdots p_n$, because
$p_i$ is a factor of $a-1$. Since $ p_i $ divides the numbers $ a $ and $ a-1 $,
it also divides the difference of these numbers. Thus: $p_i$ divides  $a - (a-1)
= 1$. $p_i$ must therefore divide $1$, which is impossible. \\*[4pt] {\bf
Contradiction:} \quad Our assumption was false.

Thus there is an {\em infinite} number of primes
\hyperlink{primhfk}{(Cross-reference: overview under 2.6.1 of the number of
prime numbers in various intervals)}.\par \vskip + 3pt

Here we may mention yet another fact which is initially somewhat surprising. 
Namely, in the prime numbers sequence $p_1, p_2, \cdots,$ gaps between prime numbers can have
an individually determined length $n$. It is undeniable that under the $n$
succession of natural numbers
$$(n+1)!+2,\cdots, (n+1)!+(n+1),
$$
none of them is a prime number since in order, the numbers $2,3,\cdots,(n+1)$  
are comprised respectively as real divisors. 
($n!$ means the product of the first $n$ natural numbers therefore 
$ n!= n*(n-1)*\cdots *2*1$).

\subsection{The search for extremely large primes}

The largest prime numbers known today have several hundred
thousand digits, which is too big for us to imagine. The number of
elementary particles in the universe is ``only'' estimated to be a
$80$-digit number \hyperlink{grosord}{(See: overview under 2.6.3
of various orders of magnitude / dimensions)}.

Almost all known huge prime numbers are special candidates, called
\index{Mersenne Marin} {\em Mersenne numbers} of the form $2^p -1,$ where $p$ is
a prime. Marin Mersenne (1588-1648) was a French priest and mathematician. Not
all Mersenne numbers are prime:

$$
\begin{array}{cl}
2^2 - 1 = 3 & \Rightarrow {\rm prime} \\
2^3 - 1 = 7 & \Rightarrow {\rm prime} \\
2^5 - 1 = 31    & \Rightarrow {\rm prime} \\
   \vdots \\
2^{11} - 1 = 2.047 = 23 \cdot 89    & \Rightarrow  {\rm NOT~prime} !
\end{array}
$$

\index{Number!Mersenne}\index{Mersenne!number}
\index{Mersenne!theorem} Even Mersenne knew that not all Mersenne numbers
are prime (see exponent $p = 11$). A prime Mersenne number \index{Mersenne!prime number} is called Mersenne prime number.  
However, he is to be thanked for the interesting conclusion that a number of the form $2^n-1$ is not a prime number
if $n$ is a composite number:

\begin{theorem}[Mersenne]\label{thm-pz-mersenne} If $2^n - 1$ is a prime number, then $n$ is also a
prime number.
\end{theorem}

\begin{Proof}{}
The theorem of Mersenne can be proved by contradiction. We therefore assume that
there exists a composite natural number $ n $ (with real factorisation)  $ n=n_1
n_2 $, with the property that $ 2^n -1 $ is a prime number.

From \begin{eqnarray*} (x^r-1)((x^r)^{s-1} + (x^r)^{s-2} + \cdots + x^r +1) & =
&  ((x^r)^s + (x^r)^{s-1} + (x^r)^{s-2} + \cdots + x^r) \\ &  & -((x^r)^{s-1} +
(x^r)^{s-2} + \cdots + x^r +1)  \\ & = & (x^r)^s -1 = x^{rs } -1,
\end{eqnarray*} we conclude \[ 2^{n_1 n_2} - 1 = (2^{n_1} -1)((2^{n_1})^{n_2 -1}
+ (2^{n_1})^{n_2 -2} + \cdots + 2^{n_1} + 1). \]
Because $ 2^n - 1 $ is a prime number, one of the above two factors on the
right-hand side must be equal to 1. This is the case if and only if $ n_1 =1 $
or $ n_2 =1$. But this contradicts our assumption. Therefore the assumption is
false. This means that there exists no composite number $ n, $ such that $ 2^n -
1 $ is a prime.
\end{Proof} \vskip + 5pt
Unfortunately this theorem only applies in one direction (the inverse does not
apply, no equivalence): see the above example $2^{11}-1, $ where $11$ is prime.

Mersenne claimed that $2^{67}-1$ is a prime number. There is also a mathematical
history behind this claim: it first took over 200 years before \index{Lucas
  Edouard} Edouard Lucas (1842-1891) proved that this number is composite.
However, he argued indirectly and did not name any of the factors. Then Frank
Nelson showed in 1903 which factors make up this composite number: $$ 2^{67} -1
=147, 573, 952, 588, 676, 412, 927 = 193, 707, 721 \cdot 761, 838, 257, 287. $$
He admitted to having worked 20 years on the factorisation (expression as a
product of factors) of this 21-digit decimal number!

Due to the fact that the exponents of the Mersenne numbers
\index{Mersenne!number} do not use all
natural numbers, but only the primes, the {\em experimental space} is limited
considerably. The currently known Mersenne prime numbers \index{Mersenne!prime number} 
have the exponents 
$$
\begin{array}{c}
2; ~ 3; ~ 5; ~ 7; ~ 13; ~ 17; ~ 19; ~ 31; ~ 61; ~ 89; ~ 107; ~ 127;
~ 521; ~ 607; ~ 1,279; ~ 2,203; ~ 2,281; ~ 3,217; ~ 4,253;\\
 4,423; ~ 9,689; ~ 9,941, ~ 11,213; ~ 19,937; ~ 21,701; ~ 23,207; ~ 44,497; ~
86,243; ~ 110,503; ~ 132,049; \\
 216,091; ~ 756,839; ~ 859,433; ~ 1,257,787; ~ 1,398,269; ~ 2,976,221; ~ 3,021,377; ~
6,972,593; \\13,466,917.
\end{array}
$$
Thus $39$ Mersenne prime numbers are currently known.

The $19$th number with the exponent $4,253$ was the first with at least $1,000$ digits in  decimal system
(the mathematician Samual \index{Yates Samual} Yates coined the expression {\em
titanic} \index{Prime number!titanic} prime for this; it was discovered by
Hurwitz in 1961); the $27$th number with the exponent $44,497$ was the first
with at least $10,000$ digits in the decimal system (Yates coined the expression
\index{Prime number!gigantic}  {\em gigantic} prime for this. These names are
now long outdated).

The 37th number was found in January 1998 and has 909,526
digits in the decimal system, which corresponds to 33 pages in the newspaper!

The 38th Mersenne prime, called M-38,
$$ 2^{6,972,593} - 1. $$
was discovered in June 1999 and has $2,098,960$ digits in the decimal system
(that corresponds to around 77 pages in the newspaper).

\subsubsection{M-39 -- December 2001} \index{Mersenne!prime number!M-39}

The 39th Mersenne prime, called M-39, $$2^{13,466,917}-1,$$ was found at December 6, 2001 –- more exactly,
the verification of this number, found at November 14, 2001 by the Canadian student Michael Cameron,
was successfully finished. This number has about 4 million decimal digits (exactly 4,053,946 digits).
Trying only to print this number $(924947738006701322247758 \cdots 1130073855470256259071)$ in the Financial Times
would need around 200 pages.

\subsubsection{GIMPS}\index{GIMPS}

Discovering the 39th Mersenne prime the GIMPS project (Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search) founded in 1996
already discovered for the 5th time the greatest Mersenne number to be proven being prime.

Now more than 130,000 volunteers, amateurs and experts, are working for the GIMPS project. They connect their
computers into the so called ``primenet'', organized by the company entropia, to find such numbers using distributed
computer programs.

\subsubsection{EFF}\index{EFF}

This search is also spurred on by a competition started by the non-profit
organisation EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) using the means of an unknown
donator. The participants are rewarded with a total of 500,000 USD if they find
the longest prime number. In promoting this project, the unknown donator is not
looking for the quickest computer, but rather wants to draw people's attention
to the possibilities offered by {\em cooperative networking}

{\href{http://www.eff.org/coopawards/prime-release1.html}{\tt http://www.eff.org/coopawards/prime-release1.html}}.

The discoverer of M-38 got for discovering the first prime with more than 1 million decimal digits 50,000 USD
from the EFF. The next price from EFF with 100,000 USD is for a proven prime with more than 10 million decimal digits.
%{\href{http://www.octocad.demon.co.uk/mersenne/prime.htm }{\tt http://www.octocad.demon.co.uk/mersenne/prime.htm}}.

Edouard Lucas (1842-1891) held the record for the longest prime number for over
70 years by proving that $2^{127}-1$ is prime. No new record is likely to last
that long.

\subsubsection{Prime number tests}
\index{Prime number!test}
In order to implement secure encryption procedures we need extremely large prime
numbers (in the region of $2^{2,048}$, i.e. numbers with $600$ digits in the
decimal system!).

Up to now we have always looked for the prime factors in order to decide whether
a number is prime. However, if even the smallest prime factor is enormous, the
search takes too long. Factorising numbers using systematic computational
division or using the sieve of Eratosthenes (see below) is only feasible using
current computers for numbers with up to around $20$ digits in the decimal
system.

However, if we know something about the {\em construction} of the number in
question, there are extremely highly developed procedures that are much quicker.
In the 17th century, Fermat wrote to Mersenne that he presumed that all numbers
of the form $$ F(n) = 2^{2^n} + 1 $$ are prime for all whole numbers $n$ greater
than or equal to $0$ (see below).

As early as in the 19th century, it was discovered that the $29$-digit number $$
F(7) = 2^{2^7} + 1 $$ is not prime. However, it was not until 1970 that
Morrison/Billhart managed to factorise it.
\begin{eqnarray*}
F(7) & = & 34,279,974,696,877,740,253,374,607,431,768,211,457 \\
& = & 59, 649, 589, 127, 497, 217 \cdot  574, 689, 200, 685,
129,054, 721.
\end{eqnarray*}
Many rapid prime number tests are based on the (little) Fermat theorem put
forward by Fermat in 1640 .
\index{Fermat!little theorem}
\begin{theorem}[``little'' Fermat]\label{thm-pz-fermat1}
Let $p$ be a prime number and $a$ be any whole number, then for all $a$ $$a^p
\equiv a \; {\rm mod} \; p.$$
This could also be formulated as follows: \\ Let $p$ be a prime number and $a$
be any whole number that is not a multiple of $p$ (also $a \not\equiv 0 \; {\rm
mod} \; p$), then $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \; {\rm mod} \; p$.
\end{theorem}

If you are not used to calculating with remainders (modulo), please simply
accept the theorem. What is important here is that this sentence implies that if
this equation is not met for any whole number $a$, then $p$ is not a prime! The
tests (e.g. for the first formulation) can easily be performed using the {\em
test basis} $a = 2$.

This gives us a criterion for non-prime numbers, i.e. a negative test, but no
proof that a number $a$ is prime. Unfortunately Fermat's theorem does not apply
--- otherwise we would have a simple proof of the prime number property (or to
put it in other words, we would have a simple prime number criterion).

Comment: Numbers that have the property $$ 2^n \equiv 2 \;{\rm mod}\; n $$ but
are not prime are called \index{Pseudoprime numbers}\index{Number!pseudoprime} {\em pseudoprime numbers}. The first pseudoprime number (i.e. not a
prime) is $$ 341 = 11 \cdot 31. $$
There are numbers that pass the Fermat test with all bases and yet are not
prime: these numbers are called \index{Number!Carmichael} {\em
Carmichael numbers}. The first of these is $$ 561 = 3 \cdot 11 \cdot 17. $$
A stronger test is provided by \index{Miller} \index{Rabin} Miller/Rabin: it is
only passed by so-called {\em strong pseudoprime numbers}. Again, there are
strong pseudoprime numbers that are not primes, but this is much less often the
case than for (simple) pseudoprime numbers. The smallest strong pseudoprime
number base $2$ is $$ 15,841 = 7 \cdot 31 \cdot 73. $$
If you test all 4 bases, $2, 3, 5$ and $7$, you will find only one strong
pseudoprime number up to $25 \cdot 10^9$, i.e. a number that passes the test and
yet is not a prime number.

More extensive mathematics behind the Rabin test delivers the probability that
the number examined is prime (such probabilities are currently around $10^{-
60}$).

Detailed descriptions of tests for finding out whether a number is prime can be
found on Web sites such as:

{\href{http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/mersenne.shtml}{\tt
http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/mersenne.shtml}} and

{\href{http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/prove/index.html}{\tt
http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/prove/index.html}}.



\subsection{The search for a formula for prime numbers}
\index{Prime number!formula}
There are currently no useful, open (i.e. not recursive) formulae known that
only deliver prime numbers (recursive means that in order to calculate the
function the same function is used with a smaller variable). Mathematicians
would be happy if they could find a formula that leaves gaps (i.e. does not
deliver all prime numbers) but does not deliver any composite (non-prime)
numbers.

Ideally, we would like, for the number $n$, to immediately obtain the $n$-th
prime number, i.e. for $f(8) = 19\,$ or for  $f(52) = 239$.

Ideas for this can be found at

{\href{http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/notes/faq/p_n.html}
 {\tt http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/notes/faq/p\_n.html}}.


Cross-reference:  \hyperlink{ntePrimzahl}{the table under 2.6.2} contains the precise values for the $n$th
prime numbers for selected $ n.$

The following are some of the most common ideas for prime number formulae:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Mersenne numbers  $f(n) = 2^n - 1$: \\
    As shown above, this formula seems to deliver relatively large prime numbers
but - as for $n=11$ [$f(n)=2,047$] - it is repeatedly the case that the result
is not prime.
  \item $F(k,n) = k \cdot 2^n \pm 1$  for $ n $ prime and $ k $ small primes:\\
   For this generalisation of the Mersenne numbers there are (for small $k$)
also extremely quick prime number tests (see \cite{Knuth1981}). This can be
performed in practice using software such as the PROTHS software from Yves
Gallot

({\href{http://www.prothsearch.net/index.html}{\tt
http://www.prothsearch.net/index.html}}).

  \item {\em Fermat numbers}\footnote{The Fermat prime numbers play a role in circel division.
As proven by Gauss\index{Gauss}, a regular $p$-edge
can only be constructed with the use of a pair of compasses and a ruler, when $p$ is a Fermat prime number.}
\index{Number!Fermat}\index{Fermat!number}  $F(n) = 2^{2^n} + 1$:\\
As mentioned above, Fermat wrote to Mersenne regarding this assumption.
Surprisingly he would have been able obtain a positive result using the negative
prime number test for $n=5$ based on his small theorem.
$$

$e_9, \cdots, e_{17}$ are also composite, which means that this formula is not

  \item $f(n) = n^2 + n + 41$:\\
  This sequence starts off very {\em promisingly},   but is far from being a
proof.

f(41) = 41 \cdot 43 &   \mapsto {\rm ~NOT~prime}! \\
\end{array} 
$$

The first $40$ values are prime numbers (which have the obvious regularity that
their difference starts with $2$ and increases by $2$ each time), but the $41$th
and $42$th values are not prime numbers.     It is easy to see that $f(41)$ hl
cannot be a prime number:
    $f(41) = 41^2 + 41 + 41 = 41 (41 + 1 + 1) = 41 \cdot 43$.
\pagebreak
  \item $f(n) = n^2 - 79 \cdot n + 1,601$: \\
    This function delivers prime numbers for all values from $n=0$ to $n=79$.
Unfortunately $f(80) = 1,681 = 11 \cdot 151$ is not a prime number. To this
date, no function has been found that delivers more prime numbers in a row. On
the other hand, each prime occurs twice (first in the decreasing then in the
increasing sequence), which means that the algorithm delivers a total of 40
difference prime values (the same ones as the function from point 10).

It is not (yet) known whether $C_5$ and higher elements are prime, but this is

In any case, it has not been proved that this formula delivers only primes.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Density and distribution of the primes}

As Euclid discovered, there is an infinite number of primes. However, some
infinite sets are {\em denser} \index{Prime number!density} than others. Within
the set of natural numbers, there is an infinite number of even, uneven and
square numbers.

The following proves that there are more even numbers than square ones:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the size of the $n$th element: \\
    The $n$th element of the even numbers is $2n$; the $n$th element of the
square numbers is $n^2$. Because for all $n>2$: $2n < n^2$, the $n$th even
number occurs much earlier than the $n$th square number.
    Thus the even numbers are distributed more densely and we can say that there
are more even numbers than square ones.
  \item the number of values that are less than or equal to a certain {\em
maximum value} $x$ in ${\mathbb R}$ is: \\
    There are $[x/2]$ such even numbers and $[\sqrt{x}]$ square numbers. Because
for large $x$ the value $x/2$ is much greater than the square root of $2$, we
can again say that there are more even numbers.
\end{itemize}
\vskip +3 pt
\begin{theorem}\label{thm-pz-density}
For large n: The value of the $n$th prime $P(n)$ is asymptotic to $n \cdot
ln(n)$, i.e. the limit of the relation  $P(n)/(n\cdot \ln n)$ is equal to $1$ if
$n$ tends to infinity.
\end{theorem}


The definition is similar for the number of prime numbers $PI(x)$
that do not exceed the maximum value $x$:

\begin{theorem}\label{thm-pz-pi-x}
$PI(x)$  is asymptotic to  $x / ln(x)$.
\end{theorem}


This is the \index{Prime number!theorem} \textbf{prime number theorem}. It was
put forward by Legendre \index{Legendre} (1752-1833) and Gauss\index{Gauss} (1777-1855) but not proved until
over 100 years later.

\hyperlink{primhfk}{(Cross-reference: overview under 2.6.1 of the number of
prime numbers in various intervals).}

For large $n$, $P(n)$  lies between  $2n$  and  $n^2$. This means that there are
fewer primes numbers than even natural numbers but more prime numbers than
square numbers.

These formulae, which only apply when n tends to infinity, can be replaced by
more precise formulae.
For $x \geq 67$:
$$ ln(x) - 1,5 < x / PI(x) < ln(x) - 0,5 $$
As we know that $PI(x)  =  x / \ln x$ only for very large $x$ ($x$ tending
towards infinity), we can create the following overview:
$$
\begin{array}{ccccc}
x     &  ln(x)  &  x / ln(x) & PI(x)(counted) &       PI(x) / (x/ln(x)) \\
10^3  &  6.908  &   144      &  168        &       1.160 \\
10^6  &  13.816 &   72,386    &  78,498          &       1.085 \\
10^9  & 20.723  &   48,254,942 &  50,847,534       &       1.054
\end{array}
$$

For a binary number (number in the binary system) of the length $250$ bits
($2^{250}$ is approximately = $1.809 251 * 10^{75}$): $$ PI(250) = 2^{250} /
(250 \cdot \ln 2) \; {\rm is~approximately} \; =  2^{250} /173.28677 = 1.045 810
\cdot 10^{73}. $$
We can therefore expect that the set of numbers with a bit length of less than
250 contains approximately $10^{73}$ primes (a reassuring result?!).

We can also express this as follows: Let us consider a {\em random} natural
number $n$. Then the probability that this number is prime is around $1 / \ln(n)$.
For example, let us take numbers in the region of $10^{16}$. Then we must
consider $ 16 \cdot \ln 10 = 36,8 $ numbers (on average) until we find a prime.
A precise investigation shows: There are $10$ prime numbers between $10^{16}-
370$ and $10^{16}-1$.

Under the heading {\em How Many Primes Are There} under

{\href{http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/howmany.shtml}{\tt
http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/howmany.shtml}}.

you will find numerous other details.

Using the following Web site:

{\href{http://www.math.Princeton.EDU/~arbooker/nthprime.html}{\tt
http://www.math.Princeton.EDU/\~{}arbooker/nthprime.html}}

you can easily determine $PI(x)$.


The \textbf{distribution} of primes displays several irregularities for which no
€system€ has yet been found. (On the one hand, many occur closely together, like
$2$ and $3,$ $ 11$ and $13, $ $ 809$ and $811$, on the other hand large gaps
containing no primes also occur. For example, no primes lie between $113$ and
$127, $ $ 293$ and $307, $ $317$ and $331, $ $ 523$ and $541, $ $ 773$ and $787,
$ $ 839$ and $853$ as well as between $887$ and $907$) (For details, see:

{\href{http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/notes/gaps.html}{\tt
http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/notes/gaps.html}}).

This is precisely part of what motivates mathematicians to discover its secrets.
\index{Eratosthenes!sieve}
\paragraph{Sieve of Eratosthenes}
An easy way of calculating all $PI(x)$ primes less than or equal to $x$ is to
use the sieve of Eratosthenes. In the 3rd century before Christ, he found an
extremely easy, automatic way of finding this out. To begin with, you write down
all numbers from 2 to $x$, circle 2, then cross out all multiples of 2. Next,
you circle the lowest number that hasn't been circled or crossed out (3) and
again cross out all multiples of this number, etc. You only need to continue
until you reach the largest number whose square is less than or equal to $x$.

Apart from 2, prime numbers are never even. Apart from 2 and 5, prime numbers
never end in 2, 5 or 0. So you only need to consider numbers ending in 1, 3, 7,
9 anyway (there are infinite primes ending in these numbers; see \cite[vol. 1,
p. 137]{Tietze1973}).

You can now find a large number of finished programs on the Internet - often
complete with source code - allowing you to experiment with large numbers
yourself. You also have access to large databases that contain either a large
number of primes or the factorisation of numerous composite numbers. The
\index{Cunningham project} \textbf{Cunningham project} for example, determines
the factors of all composite numbers that are formed as follows: $$ f(n) = b^n
\pm 1  \quad {\rm for~} b = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12 $$ ($b$ is not equal to
multiples of bases already used, such as $4, 8, 9$).

\subsection{Notes}

\textbf{Proven statements / theorems about primes}

\begin{itemize}
  \item For each number $n$ in ${\bf N}$ there are $n$ consecutive natural
numbers that are not primes.
    A proof of this can be found in \cite[p. 79]{Padberg1996}.
  \item The Hungarian mathematician Paul Erd\"os (1913-1996) proved:
    Between each random number not equal to $1$ and its double, there is at
least one prime. (He was not the first to prove this theorem, but proved it in a
simpler manner than those before him).
  \item There is a real number a such that the function $f: {\bf N} \rightarrow
{\mathbb Z}$ where $n \mapsto a^{3^n}$     only delivers primes for all $n$ (see
\cite[p. 82]{Padberg1996}).
    Unfortunately, problems arise when we try to determine $a$ (see below).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Proven statements / conjectures about primes}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The German mathematician \index{Goldbach Christian} Christian Goldbach
(1690-1764) conjectured:
    Every even natural number greater than 2 can be represented as the sum of
two prime numbers.
    Computers have verified\footnote{It is generally accepted today, that
the Goldbach Conjecture is true, i.~e.\ valid for all even natural numbers bigger than $2$.
In 1999, mathematician J\"org Richtstein from the computer sciences institute at the University
of Giessen, studied even numbers up to 400 billion and found no contradictory example (see
\href{http://www.informatik.uni-giessen.de/staff/richstein/de/Goldbach.html}{\tt http://www.informatik.uni-giessen.de/staff/richstein/de/Goldbach.html}).\index{Richstein 1999}
Nevertheless, this does not provide us with general proof.\\
The fact that despite all efforts, Goldbachs' conjecture has to date not been proven leads
one to believe that: since the pioneer work of the Austrian mathematician Kurt G\"odel \index{G\""odel Kurt} is well-known,
not every true mathematical theorem is provable (see
\href{http://www.mathematik.ch/mathematiker/goedel.html}{http://www.mathematik.ch/mathematiker/goedel.html}).
Perhaps Goldbachs' Conjecture was correct, despite that however,
proof will never be found. Conversely, that will presumably also remain unproven.}
the Goldbach conjecture for all even numbers up to
$4*10^{14}$ but no general proof has yet been found\footnote{The English
publisher {\em Faber} and the American publisher {\em Bloomsbury} issued in 2000
the 1992 published book ``Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture'' by Apostolos Doxiadis.
It's the story of an old maths professor who fails to prove a more than 250
year old puzzle. To
stimulate the sell rates the English and American publishers compete a prize of 1 million USD, 
if someone proves the conjecture -- to be published till 2004 by a well-known mathematical journal.\\
Susprisingly only British and American citizens are allowed to participate.\\
The theorem closest to Goldbach's conjecture yet was proven 1966 by Chen Jing-Run in a hard to understand fashion:
Each even integer bigger than $2$ is the sum of one prime and of the product of two primes. E.g.: $20=5+3*5.$\\
Most of the research about the Goldbach conjecture is collected in the book: ``Goldbach Conjecture'', ed. Wang Yuan, 1984, World scientific
Series in Pure Maths, Vol. 4.\\
Especially this conjecture makes transparent, that even today we do not
have fully understood the deeper connections between addition and
multiplication of natural numbers.}.
  \item The German \index{Riemann Bernhard} mathematician Bernhard Riemann
(1826-1866) put forward a formula for the distribution of primes that would
further improve the estimate. However, this has neither been proved nor
contradicted so far.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Open questions} \\

Twin primes are prime numbers whose difference is 2. Examples include 5 and 7 or
101 and 103. Triplet primes, however, only occur once: 3, 5, 7.  For all other
sets of three consecutive uneven numbers, one of them is always divisible by 3
and thus not a prime.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The number of twin primes is an open question: infinite or limited
number?
  The largest twin primes known today are $1,693,965 \cdot 2^{66,443} \pm 1.$
  \item Does a formula exist for calculating the number of twin primes per
interval?
  \item The above proof of the function  $f: N \rightarrow Z$ with $n \mapsto
a^{3^n}$  only guarantees the existence of such a number $a$.  How can we
determine this number $a$ and will it have a value, making the function also of
practical interest?
\item Is there an infinite number of Mersenne prime numbers?
\item Is there an infinite number of Fermat prime numbers?

  \item Does a polynomial time algorithm exist for calculating the prime factors of a number (see
    \cite[p. 167]{Klee1997})? 
    This question can be divided into the two following questions:
\begin{itemize} 
 \item Does a polynomial time algorithm exist that decides whether a number is
prime?
\item Does a polynomial time algorithm exist that calculates for a
  composite number $n$ a non-trivial (i.e. other than $1$ and $n$) factor
  of $n$?\footnote{Please see chapters \ref{RSABernstein} and
    \ref{NoteFactorisation}.}

\subsubsection{Orders of magnitude / dimensions in reality}
In the description of cryptographic protocols and algorithms, numbers occur that
are so large or so small that they are inaccessible to our intuitive
understanding. It may therefore be useful to provide comparative numbers from
the real world that surrounds us so that we can develop a feeling for the
security of cryptographic algorithms. Some of the numbers listed below originate
from \cite{Schwenk1996} and \cite[p.18]{Schneier1996}.  \hypertarget{grosord}{}

\section{What are prime numbers?}
\index{Prime number} \index{Number!prime}
Prime numbers are whole, positive numbers greater than or equal to $2$ that can
only be divided by 1 and themselves. All other natural numbers greater than or
equal to $2$ can be formed by multiplying prime numbers.

The {\em natural} \index{Number!natural} numbers $\mathbb{N}=\{1, 2, 3, 4,\cdots \}$ thus comprise 
\begin{itemize}
   \item the number $1$ (the unit value)
   \item the primes and
   \item the composite numbers.
\end{itemize}

Prime numbers are particularly important for 3 reasons:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In number theory, they are considered to be the basic components of
natural numbers, upon which numerous brilliant mathematical ideas are based.
  \item They are of extreme practical importance in modern
\index{Cryptography!modern} cryptography (public key \index{Cryptography!public key} cryptography). The most common public key procedure, invented at the end of
the 1970's, is \index{RSA} RSA encryption. Only using (large) prime numbers for
particular parameters can you guarantee that an algorithm is secure, both for
the RSA procedure and for even more modern procedures (digital
\index{Signature!digital} signature, elliptic curves).
  \item The search for the largest known prime numbers does not have any
practical usage known to date, but requires the best computers, is an excellent
benchmark (possibility for determining the performance\index{Performance} of computers) and leads
to new calculation methods on many computers \\
(see also: \url{http://www.mersenne.org/prime.htm}).
\end{itemize}
Many people have been fascinated by prime numbers over the past two millennia.
Ambition to make new discoveries about prime numbers has often resulted in
brilliant ideas and conclusions. The following section provides an easily
comprehensible introduction to the basics of prime numbers. We will also
explain what is known about the distribution (density, number of prime numbers
in particular intervals) of prime numbers and how prime number tests work.

\section{Prime numbers in mathematics}\label{primesinmath}

Every whole number has a factor. The number 1 only has one factor,
itself, whereas the number $12$ has the six factors $1, 2, 3, 4,
6, 12$. Many numbers can only be divided by themselves and by $1$.
With respect to multiplication, these are the ``atoms'' in the
area of numbers. Such numbers are called prime numbers.

In mathematics, a slightly different (but equivalent) definition is used.

\begin{definition}\label{def-pz-prime}
A whole number $p \in {\bf N}$ is called prime \index{Number!prime} if
$p > 1$ and $p$ only possesses the trivial factors $\pm 1$ and $\pm p$.
\end{definition}


By definition, the number $1$ is not a prime number. In the following sections,
$p$ will always denote a prime number.

The sequence of prime numbers starts with $$ 2,~ 3,~ 5,~ 7, ~ 11, ~ 13, ~
17, ~ 19, ~ 23, ~ 29, ~ 31, ~ 37, ~ 41, ~ 43, ~ 47, ~ 53, ~ 59, ~ 61,
~ 67, ~ 71, ~ 73, ~ 79, ~ 83, ~ 89, ~ 97, \cdots . $$
The first 100 numbers include precisely 25 prime numbers. After this,
the percentage of primes constantly decreases. Prime numbers can be
factorized in a uniquely {\em trivial} way: 
$$5 = 1 \cdot 5,\quad  17 = 1 \cdot 17, \quad 1,013 = 1 \cdot 1,013,  \quad
1,296,409 = 1 \cdot 1,296,409.$$
All numbers that have $2$ or more factors not equal 1 are called 
\index{Number!composite} {\em composite} numbers. 
These include $$ 4 = 2 \cdot 2, \quad 6 = 2\cdot 3 $$ as well
as numbers that {\em look like primes}, but are in fact composite:
$$ 91 = 7 \cdot 13, \quad 161=7 \cdot 23, \quad 767 =13 \cdot 59. $$

\begin{theorem}\label{thm-pz-sqr}
Each whole number $m$ greater than $1$ possesses a lowest factor greater than
$1$. This is a prime number $p$. Unless $m$ is a prime number itself, then: $p$
is less than or equal to the square root of $m$.
\end{theorem}

All whole numbers greater than $1$ can be expressed as a product of prime
numbers --- in a unique way. This is the claim of the \textbf{1st fundamental theorem of
number theory} (= fundamental theorem of arithmetic = fundamental building block
of all positive integers).\index{Number theory!fundamental theorem}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm-pz-prod}
Each element $n$ of the natural numbers greater than $1$ can be written as the
product $n = p_1 \cdot p_2 \dots p_m$ of prime numbers. If two such
factorizations $$n =  p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \cdots \cdot p_m = p'_1 \cdot p'_2 \cdots
p'_{m'}$$ are given, then they can be reordered such that $\;m = m'\;$ and for
all $i$:  $\;p_i = p'_i$. \\
($p_1, p_2, \dots, p_m$ are called the prime factors of n).
\end{theorem}

In other words: each natural number other than $1$ can be written as a product
of prime numbers in precisely one way, if we ignore the order of the factors.
The factors are therefore unique (the {\em expression as a product of factors}
is unique)! For example, $$ 60 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 2^2\cdot 3^1 \cdot
5^1. $$
And this --- other than changing the order of the factors --- is the only way in
which the number $60$ can be factorized. If you allow numbers other than primes
as factors, there are several ways of factorizing integers and the \textbf{uniqueness} \hypertarget{uniqueness}{} is
lost: $$ 60 = 1 \cdot 60 = 2 \cdot 30 = 4 \cdot 15 = 5 \cdot 12 =6 \cdot 10 = 2
\cdot 3 \cdot 10 = 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = \cdots . $$

The following section is aimed more at those familiar with mathematical logic:
The 1st fundamental theorem only appears to be obvious \label{remFundTheoOfArithm}. We can construct
numerous other sets of numbers (i.e. other than positive whole numbers greater
than 1), for which numbers in the set cannot be expressed uniquely as a product
of the prime numbers of the set: In the set $M = \{1, 5, 10, 15, 20, \cdots\}$
there is no equivalent to the fundamental theorem under multiplication. The
first five prime numbers of this sequence are $5, 10, 15, 20, 30$ (note: $10$ is
prime, because $5$ is not a factor of $10$ in this set --- the result is not an
element of the given basic set $M$). Because the following applies in $M$: $$
100 = 5 \cdot 20 = 10 \cdot 10 $$ and $5, 10, 20$ are all prime numbers in this
set, the expression as a product of prime factors is not unique here.

% --------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{How many prime numbers are there?}

For the natural numbers, the primes can be compared to elements in chemistry or
the elementary particles in physics (see \cite[p. 22]{pr:Blum1999}).

Although there are only $92$ natural chemical elements, the number of prime
numbers is unlimited. Even the Greek, \index{Euclid} Euclid%
\footnote{Euclid,
a Greek mathematician of 4th and 3rd century B.C. He worked at the
Egyptian academy of Alexandria and wrote ``The Elements'', the most well 
known systematically textbook of the Greek mathematics.} 
knew this in the third century B.C.
\begin{theorem}[Euclid\footnote{The common usage of the term does not denote Euclid as the inventor of the theorem rather;
the true inventor is merely not as prominent. The theorem has already been distinguished
and proven in Euclid's Elements (Book IX, theorem 20). The phraseology is remarkable due to 
the fact that the word infinite is not used. The text reads as followed
$$
O\acute{\iota}~\pi\varrho\tilde{\omega}\tau o \iota~\grave{\alpha}\varrho\iota\vartheta\mu o\grave{\iota}~

\pi\varrho\acute{\omega}\tau\omega\nu~
\grave{\alpha}\varrho\iota\vartheta\mu\tilde{\omega}\nu,
$$
the English translation of which is: the prime numbers are more than 
any previously existing amount of prime numbers.

The sequence of prime numbers does not discontinue.
Therefore, the quantity of prime numbers is infinite.
\end{theorem}
His proof that there is an infinite number of
primes is still considered to be a brilliant mathematical consideration and
conclusion today (\textbf{proof by contradiction} \index{Proof by contradiction}). 
He assumed that there is only a finite number of primes and therefore a 
largest prime number. Based on this assumption, he drew logical conclusions
until he obtained an obvious contradiction. This meant that something must
be wrong. As there were no mistakes in the chain of conclusions, it could
only be the assumption that was wrong. Therefore, there must be an infinite
number of primes!

\hypertarget{euclid}{}
\paragraph{Euclid's proof by contradiction}
\index{Euclid's proof by contradiction}\index{Proof by contradiction}
goes as follows:

\begin{Proof}{}
{\bf Assumption:} \quad There is a {\em finite} number of primes. \\*[4pt] {\bf
Conclusion:} \quad Then these can be listed $p_1 < p_2 < p_3 < \dots < p_n$,
where $n$ is the (finite) number of prime numbers. $p_n$ is therefore the
largest prime. Euclid now looks at the number $a = p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdots p_n +1$.
This number cannot be a prime number because it is not included in our list of
primes. It must therefore be divisible by a prime, i.e. there is a natural
number $i$ between $1$ and $n$, such that $p_i$ divides the number $a$. Of
course, $p_i$ also divides the product $a-1 = p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdots p_n$, because
$p_i$ is a factor of $a-1$. Since $ p_i $ divides the numbers $ a $ and $ a-1 $,
it also divides the difference of these numbers. Thus: $p_i$ divides  $a - (a-1)
= 1$. $p_i$ must therefore divide $1$, which is impossible. \\*[4pt] {\bf
Contradiction:} \quad Our assumption was false.

Thus there is an {\em infinite} number of primes
(Cross-reference: \hyperlink{primhfk}{overview} under \ref{s:primhfk} of 
the number of prime numbers in various intervals).
\end{Proof} 

\par \vskip + 10pt

Here we should perhaps mention yet another fact which is initially somewhat surprising. 
Namely, in the prime numbers sequence $p_1, p_2, \cdots,$ gaps between prime numbers can have
an individually determined length $n$. It is undeniable that under the $n$
succession of natural numbers
$$(n+1)!+2,\cdots, (n+1)!+(n+1),
$$
none of them is a prime number since in order, the numbers $2,3,\cdots,(n+1)$  
are comprised respectively as real divisors. 
($n!$ means the product of the first $n$ natural numbers therefore 
$ n!= n*(n-1)*\cdots *2*1$).

``Seventeen or Bust'' (SoB) (\url{http://www.seventeenorbust.com})
% {\href{http://www.mersenne.org} {\tt http://www.mersenne.org}}
at March 26, 2007. While the well known \hyperlink{GIMPS-project}{GIMPS project} (chapter~\ref{zahlentyp_mersenne}) searches for bigger and bigger of the infinitely many primes, there is a chance, that the SoB project could have been completed its
task sometime.

The SoB project tries to prove computationally, that the number $k = 78,557$ is
the smallest Sierpinski number (John Selfridge proved in 1962, that $78,557$ is a Sierpinski number).

The famous Polish mathematician Waclaw Sierpinski (1882 to 1969) proved in
1960, that there exist infinitely many odd integers k, which fulfill the
following property: For all Sierpinski numbers k it is true: All numbers $N = k \cdot 2^{n}+1$ are composite for all integers $n>=1$ (Sierpinski's Composite Number Theorem, \url{http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SierpinskisCompositeNumberTheorem.html}).

When the project started in 2002 there have been 17 possible candidates $< 78557$ (this is the reason for the project's name ``Seventeen or Bust''). It is sufficient to find one single counter-example, to exclude a candidate k, which means to find a single $n>=1$, where $N = k \cdot 2^{n}+1$ is prime. So it is only a byproduct of this task that this also generates new monster primes.

Almost all known huge prime numbers are special candidates, called
\index{Mersenne, Marin} {\em Mersenne numbers}\footnote{%
Marin Mersenne, French priest and mathematician, Sep 08, 1588 $-$ Sep 01, 1648.
\index{Mersenne, Marin}
}
of the form $2^p -1,$ where $p$ is
a prime. Not all Mersenne numbers are prime:

$$
\begin{array}{cl}
2^2 - 1 = 3 & \Rightarrow {\rm prime} \\
2^3 - 1 = 7 & \Rightarrow {\rm prime} \\
2^5 - 1 = 31    & \Rightarrow {\rm prime} \\
2^7 - 1 = 127    & \Rightarrow {\rm prime} \\
2^{11} - 1 = 2,047 = 23 \cdot 89    & \Rightarrow  {\rm NOT~prime} !
\end{array}
$$

\index{Number!Mersenne}\index{Mersenne!number}
\index{Mersenne!theorem} 

Even Mersenne knew that not all Mersenne numbers
are prime (see exponent $p = 11$). 
A prime Mersenne number \index{Mersenne!prime number} is called
Mersenne prime number.  \\
However, he is to be thanked for the interesting conclusion that a number 
of the form $2^n-1$ cannot be a prime number if $n$ is a composite number:

\begin{theorem}[Mersenne]\label{thm-pz-mersenne} 
  If $2^n - 1$ is a prime number, then $n$ is also a prime number.
\end{theorem}

\begin{Proof}{}
The theorem of Mersenne can be proved by contradiction%
\index{Proof by contradiction}.  We therefore assume that
there exists a composite natural number $ n $ (with real factorization)  
$ n=n_1 \cdot n_2 $
, with the property that $ 2^n -1 $ is a prime number.

From \begin{eqnarray*} (x^r-1)((x^r)^{s-1} + (x^r)^{s-2} + \cdots + x^r +1) & =
&  ((x^r)^s + (x^r)^{s-1} + (x^r)^{s-2} + \cdots + x^r) \\ &  & -((x^r)^{s-1} +
(x^r)^{s-2} + \cdots + x^r +1)  \\ & = & (x^r)^s -1 = x^{rs } -1,
\end{eqnarray*} we conclude \[ 2^{n_1 n_2} - 1 = (2^{n_1} -1)((2^{n_1})^{n_2 -1}
+ (2^{n_1})^{n_2 -2} + \cdots + 2^{n_1} + 1). \]
Because $ 2^n - 1 $ is a prime number, one of the above two factors on the
right-hand side must be equal to 1. This is the case if and only if $ n_1 =1 $
or $ n_2 =1$. But this contradicts our assumption. Therefore the assumption is
false. This means that there exists no composite number $ n, $ such that $ 2^n -
1 $ is a prime.
\end{Proof} 

\vskip + 5pt
\hypertarget{Mer-nums-not-always-prim}{}
Unfortunately this theorem only applies in one direction (the inverse 
statement does not apply, no equivalence): that means that there exist 
prime exponent for which the Mersenne number is {\bf not} prime (see the 
above example $2^{11}-1, $ where $11$ is prime, but $2^{11}-1$ not).

Mersenne claimed that $2^{67}-1$ is a prime number. There is also a mathematical
history behind this claim: it first took over 200 years before 
\index{Lucas, Edouard} Edouard Lucas (1842-1891) proved that this number 
is composite.
However, he argued indirectly and did not name any of the factors. Then Frank
Nelson Cole\index{Cole, Frank Nelson}\footnote{%
Frank Nelson Cole, American mathematician, Sep. 20, 1861 $-$ May 26, 1926.}
showed in 1903 which factors make up this composite number: 
$$ 2^{67} -1
=147, 573, 952, 589, 676, 412, 927 = 193, 707, 721 \cdot 761, 838, 257, 287. $$
He admitted to having worked 20 years on the factorization 
\index{Factorization} (expression as a product of prime factors)\footnote{%

Due to the fact that the exponents of the Mersenne numbers

natural numbers, but only the primes, the {\em experimental space} is limited
considerably. The currently known Mersenne prime numbers

The 39th Mersenne prime, called M-39, $$2^{13,466,917}-1,$$ was
published at December 6, 2001 -- more exactly, the verification of this number,
found at November 14, 2001 by the Canadian student Michael Cameron, was
successfully completed. 
This number has about 4 million decimal digits (exactly 4,053,946 digits).
Trying only to print this number 
$$(924947738006701322247758 \cdots 1130073855470256259071)$$
would require around 200 pages in the Financial Times.

Right now (July 2009) all prime exponents smaller than $ 18,000,989 $ have been

So we can
be certain, that this is really the 39th Mersenne prime number and that
there are no smaller undiscovered Mersenne primes (it is common usage to use
the notation M-nn not until it is proven, that the nn-th known Mersenne prime

Dr. Richard Crandall\index{Crandall, Richard} discovered the advanced 
transform algorithm used by the GIMPS program. George Woltman implemented
Crandall's algorithm in machine language, thereby producing a prime-search 
program of unprecedented efficiency,
and that work led to the successful GIMPS project.

On June 1st, 2003 a possible Mersenne prime was reported to the GIMPS server, 
which was checked afterwards as usual, before it was to be published. 
Unfortunately mid June the initiator and GIMPS project leader George Woltman
had to tell, that two independent verification runs proved the number 
was composite. This was the first false positive report of a client in 7 years.

Now more than 130,000 volunteers, amateurs and experts, participate in the 
GIMPS project. They connect their computers into the so called ``primenet'', 
organized by the company entropia.

In order to implement secure encryption procedures we need extremely large prime
numbers (in the region of $2^{2,048}$, i.e. numbers with $600$ digits in the
decimal system!).

If we look for the prime factors in order to decide whether a number is prime,
then the search takes too long, if even the smallest prime factor is enormous.
Factorizing numbers using systematic computational
division or using the \hyperlink{SieveEratosthenes01}{sieve of Eratosthenes} 
\index{Eratosthenes!sieve} is only feasible using current computers for
numbers with up to around $20$ digits in the decimal system.
The biggest number factorized into its 2 almost equal prime factors 
has 200 digits 
(see \hyperlink{RSA-200-chap3}{RSA-200} in chapter \ref{NoteFactorization}).
% be_2005_UPDATEN_if-new-factorization-record-appears

However, if we know something about the {\em construction} of the number in
question, there are extremely highly developed procedures that are much quicker.
These procedures can determine the primality attribute of a number, but they
cannot determine the prime factors of a number, if it is compound.

\hypertarget{FermatNumbers01}{}\label{FermatNumbers01}%
In the 17th century, Fermat\footnote{%
Pierre de Fermat, French mathematician, Aug 17, 1601 -- Jan 12, 1665.
\index{Fermat, Pierre}
}
\index{Fermat, Pierre} wrote to Mersenne \index{Mersenne, Marin} that he 
presumed that all numbers of the form 
$$ f(n) = 2^{2^n} + 1 $$ 
are prime for all whole numbers $ n \geq 0$ 
(\hyperlink{FermatNumbers02}{see below}, chapter~\ref{L-FermatNumbers02}).
\index{Number!Fermat}\index{Fermat!number}

As early as in the 19th century, it was discovered that the $29$-digit number $$
f(7) = 2^{2^7} + 1 $$ is not prime. However, it was not until 1970 that
Morrison/Billhart managed to factorize it.
\begin{eqnarray*}\label{F7Morrison}
f(7) & = & 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,457 \\
& = & 59, 649, 589, 127, 497, 217 \cdot  5,704,689,200,685,129,054,721
\end{eqnarray*}


\vspace{12pt}
Despite Fermat was wrong with this supposition, he is the originator of
an important theorem in this area: Many rapid prime number tests are 
based on the (little) Fermat theorem put forward by Fermat in 1640
(\hyperlink{KleinerSatzFermat-chap3}{see chapter 
\ref{Label_KleinerSatzFermat-chap3}}).

\hypertarget{KleinerSatzFermat-chap2}{}
\index{Fermat!little theorem}
\begin{theorem}[``little'' Fermat]\label{thm-pz-fermat1}
Let $p$ be a prime number and $a$ be any whole number, then for all $a$ $$a^p
\equiv a \; {\rm mod} \; p.$$
This could also be formulated as follows: \\ Let $p$ be a prime number and $a$
be any whole number that is not a multiple of $p$ (also $a \not\equiv 0 \; {\rm
mod} \; p$), then $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \; {\rm mod} \; p$.
\end{theorem}

If you are not used to calculate with remainders (modulo), please simply
accept the theorem or first read \hyperlink{Chapter_ElementaryNT}
{chapter \ref{Chapter_ElementaryNT} ``Introduction to Elementary Number Theory with 
Examples''}.  What is important here is that this sentence implies that if
this equation is not met for any whole number $a$, then $p$ is not a prime! The
tests (e.g.\ for the first formulation) can easily be performed using the {\em
test basis} $a = 2$.

This gives us a criterion for non-prime numbers, i.e. a negative test, but no
proof that a number $a$ is prime. Unfortunately Fermat's theorem does not apply
--- otherwise we would have a simple proof of the prime number property (or to
put it in other words, we would have a simple prime number criterion).

Numbers n that have the property $$ 2^n \equiv 2 \;{\rm mod}\; n $$

There are pseudo prime numbers n that pass the Fermat test 
$$ a^{n-1} \equiv 1 \;{\rm mod}\; n $$
with all bases a which are relatively prime to n [$ gcd (a,n) = 1 $],
despite these numbers n are not prime: These numbers are called
{\em Carmichael numbers}.
The first of these is $$ 561 = 3 \cdot 11 \cdot 17 .$$

Sample: The number to be tested is 561. Because $ 561 = 3 \cdot 11 \cdot 17 $
it is: \\
The test condition $ a^{560} \;{\rm mod}\; 561 = 1 $ is satisfied 
for $a = 2, 4, 5, 7, \cdots $,\\
but not for $a = 3, 6, 9, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 21, 22, \cdots $.\\ 
This means the test condition must not be satisfied for multiples of the
prime factors 3, 11 or 17.\\
The test applied for $a=3$ results in: $ 3^{560} \;{\rm mod}\; 561 = 375 $.\\
The test applied for $a=5$ results in: $ 5^{560} \;{\rm mod}\; 561 = 1 $.

Prof. Miller worked at the Carnegie-Mellon University, School of Computer
Science. Prof. Rabin, born in 1931, worked at the Harvard and Hebrew University.
}%
: it is only passed by so-called {\em strong pseudo prime numbers}. 
Again, there are strong pseudo prime numbers that are not primes, but this is
much less often the case than for (simple) pseudo prime numbers or for 
Carmichael numbers. The smallest strong pseudo prime number base $2$ is 
$$ 15,841 = 7 \cdot 31 \cdot 73. $$
If you test all 4 bases, $2, 3, 5$ and $7$, you will find only one strong
pseudo prime number up to $25 \cdot 10^9$, i.e. a number that passes the 
test and yet is not a prime number.

More extensive mathematics behind the Rabin test delivers the probability that
the number examined is prime (such probabilities are currently around $10^{-

There are currently no useful, open (i.e. not recursive) formulae known that
only deliver prime numbers (recursive means that in order to calculate the
function the same function is used with a smaller variable). Mathematicians
would be happy if they could find a formula that leaves gaps (i.e. does not
deliver all prime numbers) but does not deliver any composite (non-prime)
numbers.

Ideally, we would like, for the number $n$, to immediately be able to 
obtain the $n$-th prime number, i.e. for $f(8) = 19\,$ or for  $f(52) = 239$.

Ideas for this can be found at

    Within the project ``Distributed Search for Fermat Number Dividers''

    The discovered factors can be compound integers or primes.
     
    On February 22, 2003 John Cosgrave discovered 
    \begin{itemize} 
     \item the largest composite Fermat number to date and
     \item the largest prime non-simple Mersenne number so far with
           645,817 decimal digits.
    \end{itemize}
    
    The Fermat number
    $$ f(2,145,351) = 2^{(2^{2,145,351})} + 1 $$ 
    is divisible by the prime
    $$ p = 3*2^{2,145,353} + 1 $$ \\
    At that time this prime p was the largest known prime generalized Mersenne 
    number\index{Mersenne!number!generalized} and the
    5th largest known prime number at all. 

    This work was done using NewPGen from Paul Jobling's, PRP from 
    George Woltman's, Proth from Yves Gallot's programs\index{Gallot, Yves} and
    also the Proth-Gallot group at St. Patrick's College, Dublin.

    Generalized Fermat numbers are more numerous than Mersenne numbers of a
    equal size and many of them are waiting to be discovered to fill the
    big gaps between the Mersenne primes already found or still undiscovered.
    Progress in number theory made it possible that numbers, where the
    representation is not limited to the base 2, can be tested at almost
    the same speed than a Mersenne number.
    
    Yves Gallot\index{Gallot, Yves} wrote the program Proth.exe to investigate
    generalized Fermat numbers.
    
    Using this program at February 16, 2003 Michael Angel discovered the
    largest of them till then with 628,808 digits, which at that time became
    the 5th largest known prime number:
    $$ b^{2^{17}} + 1  =  62,722^{131,072} + 1. $$

    Unfortunately this formula is not open but recursive.

\noindent Also $e_9, \cdots, e_{17}$ are composite, which means that this formula is not

\begin{remark}{:}\\
However, what is special about these numbers is that any pair of 
them does not have a common factor other than $1$\footnote{%
This can easily be shown via the following rule for the {\em greatest common divisor gcd}\\
with $gcd(a,b) = gcd(b-\lfloor b/a \rfloor \cdot a, a)$.\\
We have for $i<j$: \\
$gcd(e_i,e_j) \le gcd(e_1 \cdots e_i \cdots e_{j-1}, e_j) = gcd(e_j - e_1 \cdots e_i \cdots e_{j-1}, e_1 \cdots e_i \cdots e_{j-1})

The first $40$ values are prime numbers (which have the obvious regularity that
their difference starts with $2$ and increases by $2$ each time), but the $41$th
and $42$th values are not prime numbers. 
It is easy to see that $f(41)$ cannot be a prime number:
    $f(41) = 41^2 + 41 + 41 = 41 (41 + 1 + 1) = 41 \cdot 43$.

date, no function has been found that delivers more prime numbers in a row. On
the other hand, each prime occurs twice (first in the decreasing then in the

different prime values (these are the same ones as delivered by the function

\section{Density and distribution of the primes}

As Euclid discovered, there is an infinite number of primes. However,
some infinite sets are {\em denser} \index{Prime number!density} than
others.

Within the set of natural numbers, there is an infinite number of even,
uneven and square numbers. How  to compare the ``density'' of two
infinite sets is shown with even and square numbers.

The following proves that the even numbers are distributed more densely
than square ones:\footnotemark
   \footnotetext{%
   Whereas in colloquial language you often can hear, that ``there are
   more'' even numbers than square ones, mathematicians say, that from
   both there are infinitely many, that their sets are equivalent to
   $ \mathbb{N}$ (so both are infinite and countable, i.e. one can
   assign to each even number and to each square number an integer),
   but that the set of even numbers is denser than the set of square
   numbers.
   }
\begin{itemize}
  \item the size of the $n$th element: \\
    The $n$th element of the even numbers is $2n$;
    the $n$th element of the square numbers is $n^2$.
    Because for all $n>2$: $2n < n^2$, the $n$th even number occurs much
    earlier than the $n$th square number.
  \item the numbers of values that are less than or equal to a certain
    {\em maximum value} $x$ in ${\mathbb R}$ are: \\
    There are $\lfloor x/2 \rfloor$ such even numbers and
    $\lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor$ square numbers.
    Because for all $x>6$ the value $\lfloor x/2 \rfloor$ is greater
    than the largest integer smaller or equal to the square root of $x$,
    the even numbers are distributed more densely.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm-pz-density}
For large n: The value of the $n$-th prime $P(n)$ is asymptotic to $n \cdot
ln(n)$, i.e. the limit of the relation  $P(n)/(n\cdot \ln n)$ is equal to $1$ if
$n$ tends to infinity.
\end{theorem}

For $n > 5$, $P(n)$  lies between  $2n$  and  $n^2$. This means that there are
fewer prime numbers than even natural numbers but more prime numbers than
square numbers\footnote{%

\hyperlink{primhfk}{Cross-reference: The overview under \ref{s:primhfk}} 
shows the number of prime numbers in various intervals.


These formulae, which only apply when n tends to infinity, can be replaced by
more precise formulae.
For $x \geq 67$:
$$ ln(x) - 1,5 < x / PI(x) < ln(x) - 0,5 $$
Given that we know $PI(x)  =  x / \ln x$ only for very large $x$ ($x$ tending
towards infinity), we can create the following overview:
$$
\begin{array}{ccccc}
x     &  ln(x)  &  x / ln(x) & PI(x)(counted) &       PI(x) / (x/ln(x)) \\
10^3  &  6.908  &   144      &  168        &       1.160 \\
10^6  &  13.816 &   72,386    &  78,498          &       1.085 \\
10^9  & 20.723  &   48,254,942 &  50,847,534       &       1.054
\end{array}
$$

For a binary number\footnote{%
Number written in the binary system consists only of the digits 0 and 1.
}  
$ x $ of the length of $250$ bits
($2^{250}$ is approximately = $1.809 251 * 10^{75}$)
it is: 
$$ PI(x) = 2^{250} / (250 \cdot \ln 2)  \;\;  {\rm is~approximately}
\; = 2^{250} / 173.28677 = 1.045 810 \cdot 10^{73}. $$
We can therefore expect that the set of numbers with a bit length of less than
250 contains approximately $10^{73}$ primes (a reassuring result?!).

We can also express this as follows: Let us consider a {\em random} natural
number $n$. Then the probability that this number is prime is around $1 / \ln(n)$.
For example, let us take numbers in the region of $10^{16}$. Then we must
consider $ 16 \cdot \ln 10 = 36,8 $ numbers (on average) until we find a prime.
A precise investigation shows: There are $10$ prime numbers between $10^{16}-
370$ and $10^{16}-1$.

no ``system'' has yet been found: On the one hand, many occur closely together,
like $2$ and $3,$ $ 11$ and $13, $ $ 809$ and $811$, on the other hand large
gaps containing no primes also occur. For example, no primes lie between $113$

\paragraph{Sieve of Eratosthenes}\mbox{}
\hypertarget{SieveEratosthenes01}{}
\index{Eratosthenes!sieve}

An easy way of calculating all $PI(x)$ primes less than or equal to $x$ is to
use the sieve of Eratosthenes. In the 3rd century B.C., he found an
extremely easy, automatic way of finding this out. To begin with, you write
down all numbers from 2 to $x$, circle 2, then cross out all multiples of 2.
Next, you circle the lowest number that hasn't been circled or crossed out
(3) and again cross out all multiples of this number, etc. You only need to
continue until you reach the largest number whose square is less than or
equal to $x$.%
\footnote{%
    \index{NT, Learning Tool for Number Theory}%
    \index{Educational tool NT}%
    With the educational tool for number theory {\bf NT} you can apply the
    sieve of Eratosthenes in a computer-aided and guided way: Enter you own
    number and do the sieving step by step:
    See learning unit 1.2, pages 6/21 and 7/21.\\

    See appendix \ref{s:appendix-Learn-NT}.
}


Apart from 2, prime numbers are never even. Apart from 2 and 5, prime numbers
never end in 2, 5 or 0. So you only need to consider numbers ending in 1, 3,
7, 9 anyway (there are infinite primes ending in these numbers; see
\cite[vol. 1, p. 137]{pr:Tietze1973}).

You can now find a large number of finished programs on the Internet - often
complete with source code - allowing you to experiment with large numbers
yourself (see chapter \ref{spezialzahlentypen}). 
You also have access to large databases that contain either a large
number of primes or the factorization of numerous composite numbers.

powers, modular roots, Chinese remainder theorem, Euler Phi function or

\section{Notes about primes}

The following notes list some interesting theorems, conjectures and open
questions about primes, but also some quaint things and overviews.

\subsection{Proven statements / theorems about primes}
\begin{itemize}

  \item For each number $n$ in ${\bf N}$ there are $n$ consecutive natural
      numbers that are not primes.
      A proof of this can be found in \cite[p. 79]{pr:Padberg1996}.

      
  \item Paul Erd\"os\footnote{%
           Paul Erd\"os\index{Erd\"os, Paul}, Hungarian mathematician,
           Mar 26, 1913$-$Sep 20, 1996. }
      proved:
      Between each random number not equal to $1$ and its double, there is
      at least one prime. He was not the first to prove this theorem, but
      proved it in a much simpler manner than those before him.
 
     
  \item % \hypertarget{link-Primzahlfunktion-base-a-Proof}{}
        \label{link-Primzahlfunktion-base-a-Proof}
      There is a real number a such that the function $f: {\bf N}
      \rightarrow {\mathbb Z}$ where $n \mapsto \lfloor a^{3^n}\rfloor$ 
      only delivers primes\footnote{%
      The Gauss\index{Gauss bracket} bracket  $\lfloor x \rfloor $ of a real number $x$
      is defined via: $\lfloor x \rfloor $ is the next integer less or equal $x$.
      } for all $n$  (see \cite[p. 82]{pr:Padberg1996}).
      Unfortunately, problems arise when we try to determine $a$ 
      (see chapter \ref{link-Primzahlfunktion-base-a-Offen}).

     of arbitrary length.\footnote{%

     }$^,$\footnote{%  Doppelfussnote
     Arithmetic sequences with k primes are called prime arithmetic progressions
     and therefore their abbreviation is PAP-k or AP-k.
     }

     In 1923 the famous British mathematician Godfrey Harold Hardy\footnote{%
     Godfrey Harold Hardy\index{Hardy, Godfrey Harold}, British mathematician,
     Feb 7, 1877$-$Dec 1, 1947.}
     compiled the conjecture, that there are arithmetic sequences of arbitrary
     length, which consist of primes only. This conjecture was proven in 2004
     by two young American mathematicians.
  
     At some point every school child learns about arithmetic number series.
     These are sequences of numbers, for which the difference between any 2 
     consecutive numbers is equal or constant (an arithmetic sequence must have
     at least three elements but can also have indefinitely many). In the 
     sample sequence 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20 the difference between the series's
     elements is 3 and the length of the sequence is 6.

     Arithmetic series have been known for millennia and one would think 
     they have no more secrets.
     They get more interesting again, if we impose additional constraints 
     on the serieís elements - as the prime example shows.

     E.g.\ 5, 17, 29, 41, 53 is an arithmetic prime series which consists of 
     5 elements and the difference between the elements is always 12.

     The sequence is not extendable - the next would be 65, but 65 is not 
     prime (65 is the product of 5 and 13).

     How many elements are possible within an arithmetic prime number sequence?
     Around 1770 the French Joseph-Louis Lagrange and the British Edward Waring
     investigated this question. In 1923 the famous British mathematician 
     Godfrey Harold Hardy and his colleague John Littlewood theorized, that 
     there is no upper limit for the number of elements. But they could not 
     prove this. In 1939 more progress was achieved: The Dutch mathematician 
     Johannes van der Corput was able to prove that there are infinitely many 
     different arithmetic prime number sequences with exactly three elements. 
     Two examples are 3, 5, 7 and 47, 53, 59.

     The longest arithmetic prime number sequence known today contains 
     25 elements.
     The table~\ref{Smallest AP-k with minimal difference}
     lists the longest currently known arithmetic prime number sequences
     with minimal difference\footnote{%
        In the opposite, in \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primes_in_arithmetic_progression}
        are the "largest known AP-k" listed. Therefore, there the last sequence element
        is a prime as big as possible. However, here are the sequences listed
        which have the smallest known difference for a given length.
     }.

     As a team, the two young\footnote{%
     Hardy\index{Hardy, Godfrey Harold} wrote in his memoirs in 1940, that
     mathematics - more than all other arts and sciences - is an activity 
     for young people. \\
     At that time 27-years-old Ben Green from the University of British
     Columbia in Vancouver and 29-year-old Terence Tao from the University
     of California in Los Angeles seem to confirm Hardy.
     }
     mathematicians Ben Green and Terence Tao, were able in 2004 to prove
     Hardy's conjecture, which had puzzled mathematicians for over 80 years:
     It states, that for any arbitrary length there exists an arithmetic prime
     number series. Additionally they managed to prove, that for any given
     length there are infinitely many different series.
 
     Green and Tao intended to proof that there are infinitely many arithmetic
     sequences of length four. For this they considered sets of numbers 
     consisting of primes and so called 
     ``near primes''\index{Near prime}\index{Prime number!near prime}.
     These are numbers with a small set of divisors like numbers which are
     the product of two primes - these numbers are called 
     ``half primes''%
     \index{Half prime}\index{Prime number!half prime}%
     \index{Prime number!semi prime}\index{Prime number!bi prime}%
     \index{Number!semi prime}\index{Number!bi prime}.
     Thus they managed to considerably simplify their work because about near
     primes there already existed a lot of useful theorems.  Finally they
     discovered that the results of their theorem were far more reaching than
     they had assumed and so they were able to prove Hardy's conjecture.

     Any one who believes that it is easy to use Green's and Tao's 49 page
     proof to compute arithmetic prime number series of arbitrary length will
     soon become disappointed, because the proof is non-constructive. It is 
     a so called proof of existence\index{Proof!of existence}\index{Proof!constructive}.
     This means that these mathematicians have shown ``only'' that these 
     series exist, but not how to find them in practice.
     
     This means that in the set of the natural numbers there is e.g.\ a series
     of one billion primes, which all have the same distance; and there are
     infinitely many of them. But these sequences lie extremely far beyond 
     the numbers we usually use (``far outside'').

     \clearpage

     If someone wants to discover such sequences he should consider the
     following thought.
     The length of a sequence determines the minimal common distance
     between the single primes of the sequence. Given a sequence with 6 
     elements the distance between them has to be 30 or a multiple of 30.
     The number 30 results as the product of all primes smaller than the
     length of the sequence. So its the product of all primes smaller than 6:
     $ 6\# = 5\# = 2 * 3 * 5 = 30 $.
     It is $ 10\# = 7\# = 2 ∑ 3 ∑ 5 ∑ 7 = 210$.
     If you look for a sequence with 15 elements, then the common
     distance is at least $15\# = 13\# = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 = 30,030$.

     This means that the length of an arithmetic prime sequence can be
     arbitrary big, but the distance between the elements cannot be any
     arbitrary number. E.g.\ there is no arithmetic prime sequence with the
     distance $100$, because 100 cannot be divided by 3.

     {\bf Further restriction:}\\
     If you look at arithmetic prime sequences, 
     which fulfill the {\em additional} requirement, that all primes are
     {\em consecutive}\footnote{%
     They are also called consecutive prime arithmetic progressions
     and therefore their abbreviation is CPAP-k or CAP-k.
     }, then its getting even more complicated. At the website
     of Chris Caldwell\footnote{%
     \url{http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=ArithmeticSequence}
     } 
     you can find further details: The longest known arithmetic prime sequence, 
     consisting only of directly consecutive primes, has a length of $10$ and
     the distance is
     $$ 10\# = 7\# = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 210 $$ \\

\subsection{Unproven statements / conjectures about primes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Christian Goldbach\footnote{%
     Christian Goldbach\index{Goldbach, Christian}, German mathematician,
     Mar 18, 1690$-$Nov 20, 1764. }
     conjectured: Every even natural number greater than 2 can
     be represented as the sum of two prime numbers.
     Computers have verified\footnote{%
     It is generally accepted today, that the \textbf{Goldbach Conjecture} is true, 
     i.~e.\ valid for all even natural numbers greater than $2$.
     In 1999, mathematician J\"org Richstein\index{Richstein 1999}
     from the computer sciences institute at the University of Giessen,
     studied even numbers up to 400 billion ($4*10^{14}$) and found no
     contradictory example (\cite{pr:Richstein1999}).\\
     In the meantime further progress was made: See\\
     \url{http://www.ieeta.pt/~tos/goldbach.html},\\
     \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach's\_conjecture},\\
     \url{http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php/GoldbachConjecture.html}.\\      
     Nevertheless, this does not provide us with general proof.\\
     The fact is that despite all efforts, Goldbach's conjecture has to 
     date not been proven. This leads one to believe that since the pioneer
     work of the Austrian mathematician Kurt G\"odel \index{G\""odel, Kurt}
     is well-known, not every true mathematical theorem is provable (see
     \url{http://www.mathematik.ch/mathematiker/goedel.html}).
     Perhaps Goldbach's conjecture was correct, but in any case the proof
     will never be found. Conversely, that will presumably also remain 
     unproven.}
     the Goldbach conjecture for all even numbers up to
     $15*10^{17}$ (as at July 2009) but no general proof has yet been
     found\footnote{%
     The English publisher {\em Faber} and the American publisher 
     {\em Bloomsbury} issued in 2000 the 1992 published book 
     ``Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture'' by Apostolos Doxiadis.
     It's the story of an old maths professor who fails to prove a more 
     than 250 year old puzzle. To boost the sales figures the English and
     American publishers have offered a prize of 1 million USD, if someone
     can prove the conjecture -- which should be published by 2004 in a 
     well-known mathematical journal.\\
     Surprisingly only British and American citizens are allowed to 
     participate.\\
     The theorem which has come closest so far to Goldbach's conjecture
     was proved by Chen Jing-Run in 1966 in a way which is somewhat hard
     to understand:
     Each even integer greater than $2$ is the sum of one prime and of 
     the product of two primes. E.g.: $20=5+3*5.$\\
     Most of the research about the Goldbach conjecture is collected in 
     the book: ``Goldbach Conjecture'', ed. Wang Yuan, 1984, World

        Two good didactical articles in German about applications of
        Benford's law are:

    does not apply to primes. 

    According to Benford's law, also called the first-digit law, the single
    digits in lists of numbers from many (but not all) real-life sources of
    data, are distributed in a non-uniform way. Especially the leading digit
    is much more often the digit \verb#1# than any other digit.

    Which empirical data applies to this "law" ist not completely clear yet.
    Timo Eckhardt analyzed in his thesis in 2008 extensively attributes of
    prime numbers. Among other things all primes until 7,052,046,499 were
    described with different bases of the positional notation.
    
    Comparing the bases 3 to 10 the deviation from Benford's law was lowest
    with base 3. Comparing the first digit for base 10 all digits are almost
    equally distributed. Analyzing bigger bases showed strong differences.

\subsection{Open questions about twin primes}

Twin primes are prime numbers whose difference is 2. 
Examples include 5 and 7, or 101 and 103,
or $1,693,965 \cdot 2^{66,443} \pm 1$. 

\noindent The biggest known twin pair nowadays is \[65,516,468,355\cdot 2^{333,333} \pm 1\]
with $100,355$ decimal digits.\footnote{\url{http://primes.utm.edu}, October 2009}

\noindent Remark: Triplet primes, however, only occur once: 3, 5, 7.  
For all other sets of three consecutive uneven numbers, one of them is 
always divisible by 3 and thus not a prime.

\noindent Open questions are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The number of twin primes: infinitely many or a limited number?

\item Does a formula exist for calculating the number of twin primes per interval?
\end{itemize}

A big step towards the solution of this problem was made by Dan Goldston,
J\'{a}nos Pintz and Cem Yildirim in 2003\footnote{%
    D. A. Goldston: ``Gaps Between Primes''\\
    \url{http://www.math.sjsu.edu/~goldston/OberwolfachAbstract.pdf}\\ 
    See also: 
    \begin{itemize}
       \item D. A. Goldstone: "Are There Infinitely Many Twin Primes?"\\
            \url{http://www.math.sjsu.edu/~goldston/twinprimes.pdf}
       \item K. Soundararajan: "Small Gaps Between Prime Numbers:
            The Work Of Goldston-Pintz-Yildirim"\\
	    \url{http://www.ams.org/bull/2007-44-01/S0273-0979-06-01142-6/S0273-0979-06-01142-6.pdf}
    \end{itemize}
                                               }. 
The three mathematicians were investigating the distribution of prime numbers.
They could proof, that \[ \liminf_{n\to\infty}{\frac{p_{n+1}-p_n}{\log{p_n}}}=0,\]
where $p_{n}$ denotes the $n$-th prime number. \\
This means that the smallest limit point ($\liminf$) of the sequence
$\frac{p_{n+1}-p_n}{\log{p_n}}$ equals zero.\\
A point is called limit point of a sequence, if there lie in any arbitrarily small
neighbourhood of that point infinitely many elements of the sequence.\\
$\log{p_n}$ is about the average distance between the prime $p_n$ and the next prime
$p_{n+1}$.\\
Hence, the term above implies, that there are infinitely many consecutive
primes with a gap between them which is arbitrarily small compared to the expected
average gap.


Moreover, it was proofed, that \[p_{n+1}-p_n < (\log{p_n})^{8/9}\] holds true
for infinitely many primes\footnote{ c't magazine 2003, no. 8, page 54}.

Those results could be the basis for the proof, that infinitely many twin primes exist.

    The proof (mentioned above in chapter \ref{link-Primzahlfunktion-base-a-Proof}) of the
    function $f: \: N \rightarrow Z$ with $n \mapsto \lfloor a^{3^n}\rfloor$  
    only guarantees the existence of such a number $a$.  How can we
    determine this number $a$ and will it have a value, making the 
    function also of some practical interest?

\item Is there an infinite number of Mersenne prime numbers?
    \index{Prime number!Mersenne}\index{Mersenne!prime number}

\item Is there an infinite number of Fermat prime numbers?

\item Does a polynomial\index{Polynomial} time algorithm exist for 
   calculating the prime factors of a number (see \cite[p. 167]{pr:Klee1997})?
   This question can be divided into the three following questions:
   \begin{itemize} 
      \item Does a polynomial time algorithm exist that decides whether a
            number is prime? \\
	    This question has been answered by the AKS algorithm\index{AKS} 
	    (see chapter \ref{PrimesinP}, ``Primes in P'': 
	    Primality testing is polynomial).

      \item Does a polynomial time algorithm exist  that calculates for a
            composite number from how many prime factors it is made up 
	    (without calculating these factors)?

      \item Does a polynomial time algorithm exist that calculates for a
            composite number $n$ a non-trivial (i.e. other than $1$ and $n$)
	    factor of $n$?\footnote{Please compare chapters \ref{RSABernstein}
	    and \ref{NoteFactorization}.}
   \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


At the end of chapter \ref{NoteFactorization},

you can see the dimensions of the numbers where the current algorithms
testing for primality\index{Primality testing} and

In summer 2004 the company Google used the number e\footnote{The base of the 
natural logarithm e is approximately 2.718 281 828 459. This is one of the most
important numbers in all of mathematics like complex analysis, finance, physics
and geometry. Now it was used the first time -- as far as I know -- for
marketing or recruitment.} 
to attract potential employees\footnote{Most of this information is taken 
from the article ``e-number crunching'' by John Allen Paulos in TheGuardian,
Sept. 30, 2004, and from the web:\\

}.


On a prominent billboard in California's Silicon Valley on July 12 there
appeared the following mysterious puzzle:
\begin{center}
{\em  (first 10 digit prime in consecutive digits of e).com  }
\end{center}

Finding the first 10 digit prime in the decimal expansion of e is not easy,
but with various software tools, one can determine that the answer is
$$ 7,427,466,391 $$

Then if you visited the website $www.7427466391.com$, you were presented 
with an even more difficult puzzle. Figuring this second puzzle out took
you to a web page that asks you, to submit your CV to Google. The ad campaign
got high attention.

Presumably Google's conceit was that if you're smart enough to solve the
puzzles, you're smart enough to work for them. Of course some days after the
launch, anyone who really wanted to discover the answers without incurring a
headache could merely do a Google search for them, since many solvers
immediately posted their solutions online.\footnote{
The second level of the puzzle, which involved finding the 5th term of a
given number sequence had nothing to do with primes any more.}

The movie originated from Carl Sagan's book with the same title.

After years of unavailing search the radio astronomer Dr. Ellie Arroway
(Jodie Foster) discovers signals from the solar system Vega, 26 light years
away. 
These signals contain the primes in the right order and without a gap. 
This makes the hero confident, that this message is different from the radio
signals which permanently hit earth and which are random and of cosmic origin
(radio galaxies, pulsars).
In an unmasking scene a politician asks her after that, why these intelligent 
aliens didn't just speak English ...

Doing communication with absolute strange and unknown beings from deep space 
is very hard especially because of 2 reasons: 
First the big distance and therefore the long transfer time makes it impossible
to exchange within an average lifetime more than one message in each direction
ne after the other.
Secondly the first contact must give the receiver of the radio signals a good
chance to notice the message and to categorize it as something from
intelligent beings.
Therefore the aliens send numbers at the beginning of their message, which
can be considered as the easiest part of any higher language, and which are
not too trivial: so they chose the sequence of primes. These special numbers
play such a fundamental role in mathematics that one can assume that they are
well known to each species who has the technical know-how to receive radio
waves.

The aliens then send a plan to build a mysterious machine ...

\subsection*{The distribution of primes}
Between $1$ and $10$ there are $4$ primes. Between $10^3$ and $10^4$ there are
already $1,061$ primes. In the interval $[10^9,10^{10}]$ lie
$404,204,977\approx 4\cdot 10^{8}$ primes and in the interval from
$10^{19}$ to $10^{20}$ there are $1,986,761,935,284,574,233\approx 1,9\cdot 10^{18}$
primes\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime\_number\_theorem}}.

Why is the difference between the number of primes in the different intervals
so big, although the boundaries of the intervals differ only by value 1 of the
exponent of the power of $10$?


\subsubsection*{The prime number theorem}
The number of primes up to a given number $x$ can approximately be determined by a formula, the so called prime number theorem. $\pi(x)$ denotes the number of primes which are smaller or equal to $x$. Then the formula is
\[\pi(x)\sim \frac{x}{\ln{x}}.\]
Note, that this formula only gives an approximation of the number of primes smaller or equal to $x$. It's getting more exact as the number $x$ increases.\\
In the following we are using the prime number theorem to examine the distribution of primes.

To understand, why the number of primes is growing so rapidly, although the boundaries
of the intervals only differ by the exponent $1$, let's have a closer look to both
components of the right side of the formula: $x$ and $\ln{x}$.


\subsubsection*{The functions $x$ and $10^x$}
The function $x$ is a straight line. It is shown in figure \ref{x} on page \pageref{x}.\\
In the next step the function of the boundaries of the intervals are drawn in figure \ref{10hochx} on page \pageref{10hochx}. To get an idea of how the functions look like, the domain of definition was chosen to be from $0$ to $10^{10}$ and from $0$ to $10$, respectively.
You can see, that with increasing exponent $x$ the numbers grow stronger.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\subfloat[$x$]{\label{x}\includegraphics[height=4cm]{figures/x.png}}
	\hfill
	\subfloat[$10^x$]{\label{10hochx}\includegraphics[height=4cm]{figures/10hochx.png}}
	\caption{Graph of the functions $x$ and $10^x$}
	\label{xund10hochx}
        \vskip +25pt 
\end{figure}


\subsubsection*{The function $\ln{x}$}
In comparison to that we consider the function $\ln{x}$. The left picture of figure \ref{lnxbis} on page \pageref{lnxbis} shows the graph with the domain of definition from $1$ to $100$. On the right picture the domain of definition was chosen between $1$ and $10^{10}$.\\
One can see that the values of the function $\ln{x}$ grow slowly compared to the growth of the function $x$. This is visualizd by the graph of both functions in one picture shown in figure \ref{xundlnxundxdurchlnx} on page \pageref{xundlnxundxdurchlnx}. In addition to that the graph of the function $\frac{x}{\ln{x}}$ was drawn in the same figure.

	\caption{The functions $x$ (blue), $\ln{x}$ (red)
                 and $\frac{x}{\ln{x}}$ (green)}
	\label{xundlnxundxdurchlnx}
        \vskip +25pt 
\end{figure}


\subsubsection*{The function $\frac{x}{\ln{x}}$}
The function $\frac{x}{\ln{x}}$ consists of the function $x$ as the numerator and the function $\ln{x}$ in the denominator, which, in comparison to $x$, increases very slowly. Compared to the number $x$ itself, the number of primes less or equal to $x$ is small. But still, $\frac{x}{\ln{x}}$ is an increasing function as you can see in figure \ref{xundlnxundxdurchlnx} on page \pageref{xundlnxundxdurchlnx}.


\subsubsection*{The number of primes in the different intervals}
To see how the number of primes in different intervals $[10^{x-1},10^{x}]$ behave, let's have a look on figure \ref{deltazehnxdurchlnxbis} on page \pageref{deltazehnxdurchlnxbis}. Here $\frac{10^{x}}{\ln{10^{x}}}$ and $\frac{10^{x}}{\ln{10^{x}}}-\frac{10^{x-1}}{\ln{10^{x-1}}}$ are visualized. The left chart shows the values for the exponent $x$ from $1$ to $5$ and the other one shows the values for $x$ from $1$ to $10$.\\
The blue bars represent the overall number of primes up to $10^x$. The red bars show how many primes lie in the interval $[10^{x-1},10^x]$, respectively. This makes clear, that the number of primes in intervals of higher exponents grows quite fast. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\subfloat[ ]{\label{deltazehnxdurchlnxbis5}
                     \includegraphics[height=4cm]{figures/deltazehnxdurchlnxbis5.png}}
	\hfill
	\subfloat[ ]{\label{deltazehnxdurchlnxbis10}

                 $[10^{x-1},10^x]$ (red) for different exponents $x$.}

\subsection{Check primality of integers generated by quadratic functions}
\index{Sage}

The following Sage code verifies the primality of integers generated
by the function $f(n) = n^2 - 9n + 61$.
The code defines a function called \verb!quadratic_prime_formula()!
that takes three arguments:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb!start! --- An integer which is the lower bound for
  integers in the sequence $\texttt{start}, \texttt{start} + 1,
  \texttt{start} + 2, \dots, \texttt{end} - 1, \texttt{end}$.

\item \verb!end! --- An integer which is the upper bound for the
  integers in the sequence $\texttt{start}, \texttt{start} + 1,
  \texttt{start} + 2, \dots, \texttt{end} - 1, \texttt{end}$.

\item \verb!verbose! --- (default: \verb!True!) a flag to signify
  whether to print a message indicating the primality of an integer
  generated by $f(n)$.
\end{itemize}

\noindent A meaningful modification of this code is to use another function, of
which the primality of its function values should be checked.


\begin{sagecode}
\begin{Verbatim}%
[fontsize=\footnotesize,fontshape=tt]
def quadratic_prime_formula(start, end, verbose=True):
    print "N -- N^2 - 9*N + 61"
    P = 0 # the number of primes between start and end
    for n in xrange(start, end + 1):
        X = n^2 - 9*n + 61
        if is_prime(X):
            P += 1
            if verbose:
                 print str(n) + " -- " + str(X) + " is prime"
        else:
            if verbose:
                 print str(n) + " -- " + str(X) + " is NOT prime"
    print "Number of primes: " + str(P)
    print "Percentage of primes: " + str(float((P * 100) / (end - start + 1)))
\end{Verbatim}
\caption{Verify the primality of integers generated by a quadratic function}
\end{sagecode}

\vspace{12pt}
With the following function call we compute the values of $f(n) = n^2 - 9n + 61$ for
$n = 0, 1, 2, \dots, 50$ and verify the primality of the generated integers:

\begin{Verbatim}%
[fontsize=\footnotesize,fontshape=tt]
sage: quadratic_prime_formula(0, 50)
 N -- N^2 - 9*N + 61
0 -- 61 is prime
1 -- 53 is prime
2 -- 47 is prime
3 -- 43 is prime
4 -- 41 is prime
5 -- 41 is prime
6 -- 43 is prime
7 -- 47 is prime
8 -- 53 is prime
9 -- 61 is prime
10 -- 71 is prime
11 -- 83 is prime
12 -- 97 is prime
13 -- 113 is prime
14 -- 131 is prime
15 -- 151 is prime
16 -- 173 is prime
17 -- 197 is prime
18 -- 223 is prime
19 -- 251 is prime
20 -- 281 is prime
21 -- 313 is prime
22 -- 347 is prime
23 -- 383 is prime
24 -- 421 is prime
25 -- 461 is prime
26 -- 503 is prime
27 -- 547 is prime
28 -- 593 is prime
29 -- 641 is prime
30 -- 691 is prime
31 -- 743 is prime
32 -- 797 is prime
33 -- 853 is prime
34 -- 911 is prime
35 -- 971 is prime
36 -- 1033 is prime
37 -- 1097 is prime
38 -- 1163 is prime
39 -- 1231 is prime
40 -- 1301 is prime
41 -- 1373 is prime
42 -- 1447 is prime
43 -- 1523 is prime
44 -- 1601 is prime
45 -- 1681 is NOT prime
46 -- 1763 is NOT prime
47 -- 1847 is prime
48 -- 1933 is prime
49 -- 2021 is NOT prime
50 -- 2111 is prime
Number of primes: 48
Percentage of primes: 94.1176470588
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent The last two lines of the output contain a small statistics.
You can see that $f(n)$ generates
48 primes when $0 \leq n \leq 50$, which is approximately 94\% of the
values generated by $f(n)$.\\

For larger sequences, it is impractical to print all single messages indicating the
primality of integers. In the following Sage session, we count the
number of primes generated by $f(n)$ where $0 \leq n \leq 1000$ and
suppress primality messages.

\begin{Verbatim}%
[fontsize=\footnotesize,fontshape=tt]
sage: quadratic_prime_formula(0, 1000, False)
N -- N^2 - 9*N + 61
Number of primes: 584
Percentage of primes: 58.3416583417

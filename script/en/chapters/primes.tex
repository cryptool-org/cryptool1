\subsection{What are prime numbers?}
\index{Prime number} \index{Number!prime}
Prime numbers are whole, positive numbers greater than or equal to $2$ that can
only be divided by 1 and themselves. All other natural numbers greater than or
equal to $2$ can be formed by multiplying prime numbers.

The {\em natural} \index{Number!natural} numbers $\mathbb{N}=\{1, 2, 3, 4,\cdots \}$ thus comprise 
\begin{itemize}
   \item the number $1$ (the unit value)
   \item the primes and
   \item the composite numbers.
\end{itemize}

Prime numbers are particularly important for 3 reasons:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In number theory, they are considered to be the basic components of
natural numbers, upon which numerous brilliant mathematical ideas are based.
  \item They are of extreme practical importance in modern
\index{Cryptography!modern} cryptography (public key \index{Cryptography!public key} cryptography). The most common public key procedure, invented at the end of
the 1970's, is \index{RSA} RSA encryption. Only using (large) prime numbers for
particular parameters can you guarantee that an algorithm is secure, both for
the RSA procedure and for even more modern procedures (digital
\index{Signature!digital} signature, elliptic curves).
  \item The search for the largest known prime numbers does not have any
practical usage known to date, but requires the best computers, is an excellent
benchmark (possibility for determining the performance\index{Performance} of computers) and leads
to new calculation methods on many computers \\ (see also:
\href{http://www.mersenne.org/prime.htm}{\tt
http://www.mersenne.org/prime.htm}).
\end{itemize}
Many people have been fascinated by prime numbers over the past two millennia.
Ambition to make new discoveries about prime numbers has often resulted in
brilliant ideas and conclusions. The following section provides an easily
comprehensible introduction to the basics of prime numbers. We will also explain
what is known about the distribution (density, number of prime numbers in
particular intervals) of prime numbers and how prime number tests work.


% --------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Prime numbers in mathematics}\label{primesinmath}

Every whole number has a factor. The number 1 only has one factor,
itself, whereas the number $12$ has the six factors $1, 2, 3, 4,
6, 12$. Many numbers can only be divided by themselves and by $1$.
With respect to multiplication, these are the ``atoms'' in the
area of numbers. Such numbers are called prime numbers.

In mathematics, a slightly different (but equivalent) definition is used.

\begin{definition}\label{def-pz-prime}
A whole number $p \in {\bf N}$ is called prime \index{Number!prime} if
$p > 1$ and $p$ only possesses the trivial factors $\pm 1$ and $\pm p$.
\end{definition}


By definition, the number $1$ is not a prime number. In the following sections,
$p$ will always denote a prime number.

The sequence of prime numbers starts with $$ 2,~ 3,~ 5,~ 7, ~ 11, ~ 13, ~
17, ~ 19, ~ 23, ~ 29, ~ 31, ~ 37, ~ 41, ~ 43, ~ 47, ~ 53, ~ 59, ~ 61,
~ 67, ~ 71, ~ 73, ~ 79, ~ 83, ~ 89, ~ 97, \cdots . $$
The first 100 numbers include precisely 25 prime numbers. After this,
the percentage of primes constantly decreases. Prime numbers can be
factorised in a uniquely {\em trivial} way: 
$$5 = 1 \cdot 5,\quad  17 = 1 \cdot 17, \quad 1,013 = 1 \cdot 1,013,  \quad
1,296,409 = 1 \cdot 1,296,409.$$
All numbers that have $2$ or more factors not equal 1 are called 
\index{Number!composite} {\em composite} numbers. 
These include $$ 4 = 2 \cdot 2, \quad 6 = 2\cdot 3 $$ as well
as numbers that {\em look like primes}, but are in fact composite:
$$ 91 = 7 \cdot 13, \quad 161=7 \cdot 23, \quad 767 =13 \cdot 59. $$

\begin{theorem}\label{thm-pz-sqr}
Each whole number $m$ greater than $1$ possesses a lowest factor greater than
$1$. This is a prime number $p$. Unless $m$ is a prime number itself, then: $p$
is less than or equal to the square root of $m$.
\end{theorem}

All whole numbers greater than $1$ can be expressed as a product of prime
numbers --- in a unique way. This is the claim of the 1st fundamental theorem of
number theory (= fundamental theorem of arithmetic = fundamental building block
of all positive integers).\index{Number theory!fundamental theorem}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm-pz-prod}
Each element $n$ of the natural numbers greater than $1$ can be written as the
product $n = p_1 \cdot p_2 \dots p_m$ of prime numbers. If two such
factorisations $$n =  p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \cdots \cdot p_m = p'_1 \cdot p'_2 \cdots
p'_{m'}$$ are given, then they can be reordered such that $\;m = m'\;$ and for
all $i$:  $\;p_i = p'_i$. \\
($p_1, p_2, \dots, p_m$ are called the prime factors of n).
\end{theorem}

In other words: each natural number other than $1$ can be written as a product
of prime numbers in precisely one way, if we ignore the order of the factors.
The factors are therefore unique (the {\em expression as a product of factors}
is unique)! For example, $$ 60 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 2^2\cdot 3^1 \cdot
5^1. $$
And this --- other than changing the order of the factors --- is the only way in
which the number $60$ can be factorised. If you allow numbers other than primes
as factors, there are several ways of factorising integers and the uniqueness \hypertarget{uniqueness}{} is
lost: $$ 60 = 1 \cdot 60 = 2 \cdot 30 = 4 \cdot 15 = 5 \cdot 12 =6 \cdot 10 = 2
\cdot 3 \cdot 10 = 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = \cdots . $$

The following section is aimed more at those familiar with mathematical logic:
The 1st fundamental theorem only appears to be obvious \label{remFundTheoOfArithm}. We can construct
numerous other sets of numbers (i.e. other than positive whole numbers greater
than 1), for which numbers in the set cannot be expressed uniquely as a product
of the prime numbers of the set: In the set $M = \{1, 5, 10, 15, 20, \cdots\}$
there is no equivalent to the fundamental theorem under multiplication. The
first five prime numbers of this sequence are $5, 10, 15, 20, 30$ (note: $10$ is
prime, because $5$ is not a factor of $10$ in this set --- the result is not an
element of the given basic set $M$). Because the following applies in $M$: $$
100 = 5 \cdot 20 = 10 \cdot 10 $$ and $5, 10, 20$ are all prime numbers in this
set, the expression as a product of prime factors is not unique here.

% --------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{How many prime numbers are there?}

For the natural numbers, the primes can be compared to elements in chemistry or
the elementary particles in physics (see \cite[p. 22]{Blum1999}).

Although there are only $92$ natural chemical elements, the number of prime
numbers is unlimited. Even the Greek, \index{Euclid} Euclid%
\footnote{Euclid,
a Greek mathematician of 4th and 3rd century B.C. He worked at the
Egyptian academy of Alexandria and wrote ``The Elements'', the most well 
known systematically textbook of the Greek mathematics.} 
knew this in the third century B.C.
\begin{theorem}[Euclid\footnote{The common usage of the term does not denote Euclid as the inventor of the theorem rather;
the true inventor is merely not as prominent. The theorem has already been distinguished
and proven in Euclid's Elements (Book IX, theorem 20). The phraseology is remarkable due to 
the fact that the word infinite is not used. The text reads as followed
$$

$$
the English translation of which is: the prime numbers are more than 
any previously existing amount of prime numbers.

The sequence of prime numbers does not discontinue.
Therefore, the quantity of prime numbers is infinite.
\end{theorem}
His proof that there is an infinite number of
primes is still considered to be a brilliant mathematical consideration and
conclusion today (proof by contradiction \index{Proof by contradiction}). 
He assumed that there is only a finite number of primes and therefore a 
largest prime number. Based on this assumption, he drew logical conclusions
until he obtained an obvious contradiction. This meant that something must
be wrong. As there were no mistakes in the chain of conclusions, it could
only be the assumption that was wrong. Therefore, there must be an infinite
number of primes!

\hypertarget{euclid}{}
\paragraph{Euclid's proof by contradiction}
\index{Euclid's proof by contradiction}\index{Proof by contradiction}
goes as follows:

\begin{Proof}{}
{\bf Assumption:} \quad There is a {\em finite} number of primes. \\*[4pt] {\bf
Conclusion:} \quad Then these can be listed $p_1 < p_2 < p_3 < \dots < p_n$,
where $n$ is the (finite) number of prime numbers. $p_n$ is therefore the
largest prime. Euclid now looks at the number $a = p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdots p_n +1$.
This number cannot be a prime number because it is not included in our list of
primes. It must therefore be divisible by a prime, i.e. there is a natural
number $i$ between $1$ and $n$, such that $p_i$ divides the number $a$. Of
course, $p_i$ also divides the product $a-1 = p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdots p_n$, because
$p_i$ is a factor of $a-1$. Since $ p_i $ divides the numbers $ a $ and $ a-1 $,
it also divides the difference of these numbers. Thus: $p_i$ divides  $a - (a-1)
= 1$. $p_i$ must therefore divide $1$, which is impossible. \\*[4pt] {\bf
Contradiction:} \quad Our assumption was false.

Thus there is an {\em infinite} number of primes
(Cross-reference: \hyperlink{primhfk}{overview} under \ref{s:primhfk} of 
the number of prime numbers in various intervals).
\end{Proof} 

\par \vskip + 10pt

Here we should perhaps mention yet another fact which is initially somewhat surprising. 
Namely, in the prime numbers sequence $p_1, p_2, \cdots,$ gaps between prime numbers can have
an individually determined length $n$. It is undeniable that under the $n$
succession of natural numbers
$$(n+1)!+2,\cdots, (n+1)!+(n+1),
$$
none of them is a prime number since in order, the numbers $2,3,\cdots,(n+1)$  
are comprised respectively as real divisors. 
($n!$ means the product of the first $n$ natural numbers therefore 
$ n!= n*(n-1)*\cdots *2*1$).

\subsection{The search for extremely large primes}
\label{search_for_very_big_primes}   % chap. 2.4

The largest prime numbers known today have several millions digits (M-39), 
which is too big for us to imagine. The number of elementary particles in
the universe is ``only'' estimated to be a $80$-digit number 
\hyperlink{grosord}{(See: overview under \ref{s:grosord}

\subsubsection{Special number types -- Mersenne numbers} 
\index{Mersenne!number}
\label{zahlentyp_mersenne}

Almost all known huge prime numbers are special candidates, called
\index{Mersenne Marin} {\em Mersenne numbers} of the form $2^p -1,$ where $p$ is
a prime. Marin Mersenne (1588-1648) was a French priest and mathematician. Not
all Mersenne numbers are prime:

$$
\begin{array}{cl}
2^2 - 1 = 3 & \Rightarrow {\rm prime} \\
2^3 - 1 = 7 & \Rightarrow {\rm prime} \\
2^5 - 1 = 31    & \Rightarrow {\rm prime} \\
2^7 - 1 = 127    & \Rightarrow {\rm prime} \\
2^{11} - 1 = 2.047 = 23 \cdot 89    & \Rightarrow  {\rm NOT~prime} !
\end{array}
$$

\index{Number!Mersenne}\index{Mersenne!number}
\index{Mersenne!theorem} 

Even Mersenne knew that not all Mersenne numbers
are prime (see exponent $p = 11$). 
A prime Mersenne number \index{Mersenne!prime number} is called
Mersenne prime number.  \\
However, he is to be thanked for the interesting conclusion that a number 
of the form $2^n-1$ cannot be a prime number if $n$ is a composite number:

\begin{theorem}[Mersenne]\label{thm-pz-mersenne} 
  If $2^n - 1$ is a prime number, then $n$ is also a prime number.
\end{theorem}

\begin{Proof}{}
The theorem of Mersenne can be proved by contradiction%
\index{Proof by contradiction}.  We therefore assume that
there exists a composite natural number $ n $ (with real factorisation)  
$ n=n_1 \cdot n_2 $, with the property that $ 2^n -1 $ is a prime number.

From \begin{eqnarray*} (x^r-1)((x^r)^{s-1} + (x^r)^{s-2} + \cdots + x^r +1) & =
&  ((x^r)^s + (x^r)^{s-1} + (x^r)^{s-2} + \cdots + x^r) \\ &  & -((x^r)^{s-1} +
(x^r)^{s-2} + \cdots + x^r +1)  \\ & = & (x^r)^s -1 = x^{rs } -1,
\end{eqnarray*} we conclude \[ 2^{n_1 n_2} - 1 = (2^{n_1} -1)((2^{n_1})^{n_2 -1}
+ (2^{n_1})^{n_2 -2} + \cdots + 2^{n_1} + 1). \]
Because $ 2^n - 1 $ is a prime number, one of the above two factors on the
right-hand side must be equal to 1. This is the case if and only if $ n_1 =1 $
or $ n_2 =1$. But this contradicts our assumption. Therefore the assumption is
false. This means that there exists no composite number $ n, $ such that $ 2^n -
1 $ is a prime.
\end{Proof} 

\vskip + 5pt
\hypertarget{Mer-nums-not-always-prim}{}
Unfortunately this theorem only applies in one direction (the inverse 
statement does not apply, no equivalence): that means that there exist 
prime exponent for which the Mersenne number is {\bf not} prime (see the 
above example $2^{11}-1, $ where $11$ is prime, but $2^{11}-1$ not).

Mersenne claimed that $2^{67}-1$ is a prime number. There is also a mathematical
history behind this claim: it first took over 200 years before 
\index{Lucas Edouard} Edouard Lucas (1842-1891) proved that this number 
is composite.
However, he argued indirectly and did not name any of the factors. Then Frank
Nelson showed in 1903 which factors make up this composite number: 
$$ 2^{67} -1
=147, 573, 952, 589, 676, 412, 927 = 193, 707, 721 \cdot 761, 838, 257, 287. $$
He admitted to having worked 20 years on the factorisation 
\index{Factorisation} (expression as a product of prime factors)\footnote{%
Using CrypTool\index{CrypTool} v1.3 you can factorize numbers in the 
following way: menu {\bf Indiv. Procedures \textbackslash{} RSA Demonstration 
\textbackslash{} Factorisation of a Number}.
}
of this 21-digit decimal number!

Due to the fact that the exponents of the Mersenne numbers
\index{Mersenne!number} do not use all
natural numbers, but only the primes, the {\em experimental space} is limited
considerably. The currently known Mersenne prime numbers 
\index{Mersenne!prime number} have the exponents 
$$
\begin{array}{c}
2; ~ 3; ~ 5; ~ 7; ~ 13; ~ 17; ~ 19; ~ 31; ~ 61; ~ 89; ~ 107; ~ 127;
~ 521; ~ 607; ~ 1,279; ~ 2,203; ~ 2,281; ~ 3,217; ~ 4,253;\\

$$
Thus

Mersenne prime numbers are currently known%
\index{Prime number!Mersenne}\index{Mersenne!prime number}. 
For the first 38 Mersenne prime numbers we know that this list is complete.
The exponents until the 39th Mersenne prime number have not yet been checked
completely (see chapter \ref{primality_tests}, 
prime number tests\index{Prime number!test}).

The $19$th number with the exponent $4,253$ was the first with at least $1,000$ digits in  decimal system
(the mathematician Samual \index{Yates Samual} Yates coined the expression {\em
titanic} \index{Prime number!titanic} prime for this; it was discovered by
Hurwitz in 1961); the $27$th number with the exponent $44,497$ was the first
with at least $10,000$ digits in the decimal system (Yates coined the expression
\index{Prime number!gigantic}  {\em gigantic} prime for this. These names are
now long outdated).

\subsection{Prime number tests}
\label{primality_tests}   % chap. 2.5
\index{Prime number!test}

In order to implement secure encryption procedures we need extremely large prime
numbers (in the region of $2^{2,048}$, i.e. numbers with $600$ digits in the
decimal system!).

Up to now we have looked for the prime factors in order to decide whether
a number is prime. However, even if the smallest prime factor is enormous, the
search takes too long. Factorising numbers using systematic computational
division or using the \hyperlink{SieveEratosthenes01}{sieve of Eratosthenes} 
\index{Eratosthenes!sieve} is only feasible using current computers for
numbers with up to around $20$ digits in the decimal system.
The biggest number factorized into its 2 almost equal prime factors 
has 158 digits (see \hyperlink{C158-chap3}{chapter \ref{NoteFactorisation}}).

However, if we know something about the {\em construction} of the number in
question, there are extremely highly developed procedures that are much quicker.
These procedures can determine the primality attribute of a number, but they
cannot determine the prime factors of a number, if it is compound.

\hypertarget{FermatNumbers01}{}\label{FermatNumbers01}%
In the 17th century, Fermat\index{Fermat Pierre} wrote to Mersenne \index{Mersenne Marin} that he presumed that all numbers
of the form $$ F(n) = 2^{2^n} + 1 $$ are prime for all whole numbers $n$ greater
than or equal to $0$ (\hyperlink{FermatNumbers02}{see below}) 
\index{Number!Fermat}\index{Fermat!number}

As early as in the 19th century, it was discovered that the $29$-digit number $$
F(7) = 2^{2^7} + 1 $$ is not prime. However, it was not until 1970 that

Despite Fermat was wrong with this supposition, he is the originator of
an important theorem in this area: Many rapid prime number tests are 
based on the (little) Fermat theorem put forward by Fermat in 1640
(\hyperlink{KleinerSatzFermat-chap3}{see chapter 
\ref{Label_KleinerSatzFermat-chap3}}).

\hypertarget{KleinerSatzFermat-chap2}{}
\index{Fermat!little theorem}
\begin{theorem}[``little'' Fermat]\label{thm-pz-fermat1}
Let $p$ be a prime number and $a$ be any whole number, then for all $a$ $$a^p
\equiv a \; {\rm mod} \; p.$$
This could also be formulated as follows: \\ Let $p$ be a prime number and $a$
be any whole number that is not a multiple of $p$ (also $a \not\equiv 0 \; {\rm
mod} \; p$), then $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \; {\rm mod} \; p$.
\end{theorem}

If you are not used to calculating with remainders (modulo), please simply
accept the theorem or first read \hyperlink{Kapitel_3}
{chapter \ref{Kapitel_3} ``Introduction to Elementary Number Theory with 
Examples''}.  What is important here is that this sentence implies that if
this equation is not met for any whole number $a$, then $p$ is not a prime! The
tests (e.g. for the first formulation) can easily be performed using the {\em
test basis} $a = 2$.

This gives us a criterion for non-prime numbers, i.e. a negative test, but no
proof that a number $a$ is prime. Unfortunately Fermat's theorem does not apply
--- otherwise we would have a simple proof of the prime number property (or to
put it in other words, we would have a simple prime number criterion).

Comment: Numbers n that have the property $$ 2^n \equiv 2 \;{\rm mod}\; n $$
but are not prime are called {\em pseudo prime numbers}
\index{Prime number!pseudo prime}\index{Number!pseudo prime}(i.e. the 
exponent is not a prime). 
The first pseudo prime number is $$ 341 = 11 \cdot 31 $$.
There are numbers that pass the Fermat test with all bases and yet are not
prime: these numbers are called \index{Number!Carmichael} {\em
Carmichael numbers}. The first of these is $$ 561 = 3 \cdot 11 \cdot 17 $$.

A stronger test is provided by\index{Miller Gary L.}\index{Rabin Michael O.}
Miller/Rabin\footnote{
In 1976 an efficient probabilistic primality test was published by Prof. Rabin, based on a number theoretic result of Prof. Miller from the year before. \\
Prof. Miller worked at the Carnegie-Mellon University, School of Computer
Science. Prof. Rabin, born in 1931, worked at the Harvard and Hebrew University.
}%
: it is
only passed by so-called {\em strong pseudo prime numbers}. Again, there are
strong pseudo prime numbers that are not primes, but this is much less often the
case than for (simple) pseudo prime numbers. The smallest strong pseudo prime
number base $2$ is $$ 15,841 = 7 \cdot 31 \cdot 73. $$
If you test all 4 bases, $2, 3, 5$ and $7$, you will find only one strong
pseudo prime number up to $25 \cdot 10^9$, i.e. a number that passes the 
test and yet is not a prime number.

More extensive mathematics behind the Rabin test delivers the probability that
the number examined is prime (such probabilities are currently around $10^{-
60}$).

\subsection{Further special number types and the search for a formula for primes}\label{spezialzahlentypen}
\index{Prime number!formula}
There are currently no useful, open (i.e. not recursive) formulae known that
only deliver prime numbers (recursive means that in order to calculate the
function the same function is used with a smaller variable). Mathematicians
would be happy if they could find a formula that leaves gaps (i.e. does not
deliver all prime numbers) but does not deliver any composite (non-prime)
numbers.

Ideally, we would like, for the number $n$, to immediately be able to 
obtain the $n$-th prime number, i.e. for $f(8) = 19\,$ or for  $f(52) = 239$.

Ideas for this can be found at

    to deliver relatively large prime numbers but - as for $n=11$ 
    [$f(n)=2,047$] - it is repeatedly the case that the result even with
    prime exponents is \hyperlink{Mer-nums-not-always-prim}{not} prime.\\

   The \index{Cunningham project} \textbf{Cunningham project} determines
   the factors of all composite numbers that are formed as follows:
   $$ f(n) = b^n \pm 1  \quad {\rm for~} b = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12 $$

    The Fermat number
    $$ F[2,145,351] = 2^{(2^{2,145,351})} + 1 $$ 
    is divisible by the prime
    $$ p = 3*2^{2,145,353} + 1 $$ \\
    This prime p is the largest known prime generalized Mersenne 
    number\index{Mersenne!number!generalized} and the
    5th largest known prime number today. 
    It was discovered only a few days after Michael Angel has come across the 
    largest generalized Fermat number (\hyperlink{generalizedFermatprimes}
    {see below}).  This moved GIMPS' \index{GIMPS} first prime discovery,
    M-35 = M1398269, into 7th place.

    $e_{n-1}$ is not the $(n-1)$th prime number, but the number

    Unfortunately this formula is not open but recursive.

$e_9, \cdots, e_{17}$ are also composite, which means that this formula is not

\subsubsection{$f(n) = n^2 + n + 41$}
%  \item $f(n) = n^2 + n + 41$:\\
  This sequence starts off very {\em promisingly},  
  but is far from being a proof.

$$
 \begin{array}{ll}

f(41) = 41 \cdot 43 &   \mapsto {\rm ~NOT~prime}! \\
\end{array} 
$$

The first $40$ values are prime numbers (which have the obvious regularity that
their difference starts with $2$ and increases by $2$ each time), but the $41$th
and $42$th values are not prime numbers. 
It is easy to see that $f(41)$ cannot be a prime number:
    $f(41) = 41^2 + 41 + 41 = 41 (41 + 1 + 1) = 41 \cdot 43$.


\subsubsection{$f(n) = n^2 - 79 \cdot n + 1,601$}
%  \item $f(n) = n^2 - 79 \cdot n + 1,601$: \\
    This function delivers prime numbers for all values from $n=0$ to $n=79$.
Unfortunately $f(80) = 1,681 = 11 \cdot 151$ is not a prime number. To this
date, no function has been found that delivers more prime numbers in a row. On
the other hand, each prime occurs twice (first in the decreasing then in the
increasing sequence), which means that the algorithm delivers a total of 40
difference prime values (the same ones as the function from point 11).

It is not (yet) known whether $C_5$ and all higher elements are prime, but
this is not very likely.

\subsection{Density and distribution of the primes}

As Euclid discovered, there is an infinite number of primes. However, some
infinite sets are {\em denser} \index{Prime number!density} than others. Within
the set of natural numbers, there is an infinite number of even, uneven and
square numbers.

The following proves that there are more even numbers than square ones:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the size of the $n$th element: \\
    The $n$th element of the even numbers is $2n$; the $n$th element of the
square numbers is $n^2$. Because for all $n>2$: $2n < n^2$, the $n$th even
number occurs much earlier than the $n$th square number.
    Thus the even numbers are distributed more densely and we can say that there
are more even numbers than square ones.
  \item the number of values that are less than or equal to a certain {\em
maximum value} $x$ in ${\mathbb R}$ is: \\
    There are $[x/2]$ such even numbers and $[\sqrt{x}]$ square numbers. Because
for large $x$ the value $x/2$ is much greater than the square root of $2$, we
can again say that there are more even numbers.
\end{itemize}

\vskip +3 pt
\begin{theorem}\label{thm-pz-density}
For large n: The value of the $n$-th prime $P(n)$ is asymptotic to $n \cdot
ln(n)$, i.e. the limit of the relation  $P(n)/(n\cdot \ln n)$ is equal to $1$ if
$n$ tends to infinity.
\end{theorem}

For large $n$, $P(n)$  lies between  $2n$  and  $n^2$. This means that there are
fewer prime numbers than even natural numbers but more prime numbers than
square numbers.
This already is true from the 5th prime, as you can see in 
\hyperlink{ntePrimzahl}{the table \ref{s:ntePrimzahl}}: $P(5) = 11$.


The definition is similar for the number of prime numbers $PI(x)$
that do not exceed the maximum value $x$:

\begin{theorem}\label{thm-pz-pi-x}
$PI(x)$  is asymptotic to  $x / ln(x)$.
\end{theorem}


This is the \index{Prime number!theorem} \textbf{prime number theorem}. 
It was put forward by Legendre\footnote{%
  Adrien-Marie Legendre\index{Legendre Adrien-Marie}, 
  French mathematician, Sep 18, 1752 $-$ Jan 10, 1833.
}
and Gauss\footnote{%
  Carl Friedrich Gauss\index{Gauss Carl Friedrich}, 
  German mathematician and astronomer, Apr 30, 1777$-$Feb 23, 1855.
}
but not proved until over 100 years later.

\hyperlink{primhfk}{Cross-reference: The overview under \ref{s:primhfk}} 
shows the number of prime numbers in various intervals.


These formulae, which only apply when n tends to infinity, can be replaced by
more precise formulae.
For $x \geq 67$:
$$ ln(x) - 1,5 < x / PI(x) < ln(x) - 0,5 $$
Given that we know $PI(x)  =  x / \ln x$ only for very large $x$ ($x$ tending
towards infinity), we can create the following overview:
$$
\begin{array}{ccccc}
x     &  ln(x)  &  x / ln(x) & PI(x)(counted) &       PI(x) / (x/ln(x)) \\
10^3  &  6.908  &   144      &  168        &       1.160 \\
10^6  &  13.816 &   72,386    &  78,498          &       1.085 \\
10^9  & 20.723  &   48,254,942 &  50,847,534       &       1.054
\end{array}
$$

For a binary number (number in the binary system) x of the length $250$ bits
($2^{250}$ is approximately = $1.809 251 * 10^{75}$): 
$$ PI(x) = 2^{250} / (250 \cdot \ln 2) \; {\rm is~approximately} \; =  2^{250} /173.28677 = 1.045 810 \cdot 10^{73}. $$
We can therefore expect that the set of numbers with a bit length of less than
250 contains approximately $10^{73}$ primes (a reassuring result?!).

We can also express this as follows: Let us consider a {\em random} natural
number $n$. Then the probability that this number is prime is around $1 / \ln(n)$.
For example, let us take numbers in the region of $10^{16}$. Then we must
consider $ 16 \cdot \ln 10 = 36,8 $ numbers (on average) until we find a prime.
A precise investigation shows: There are $10$ prime numbers between $10^{16}-
370$ and $10^{16}-1$.

you can easily determine $PI(x)$.


The \textbf{distribution} of primes displays several irregularities for which no
ÄsystemÄ has yet been found: On the one hand, many occur closely together, like
$2$ and $3,$ $ 11$ and $13, $ $ 809$ and $811$, on the other hand large gaps
containing no primes also occur. For example, no primes lie between $113$ and
$127, $ $ 293$ and $307, $ $317$ and $331, $ $ 523$ and $541, $ $ 773$ and $787,
$ $ 839$ and $853$ as well as between $887$ and $907$. \\

This is precisely part of what motivates mathematicians to discover its secrets.

\index{Eratosthenes!sieve}
\paragraph{Sieve of Eratosthenes}\mbox{}
\hypertarget{SieveEratosthenes01}{}

An easy way of calculating all $PI(x)$ primes less than or equal to $x$ is to
use the sieve of Eratosthenes. In the 3rd century B.C., he found an
extremely easy, automatic way of finding this out. To begin with, you write down
all numbers from 2 to $x$, circle 2, then cross out all multiples of 2. Next,
you circle the lowest number that hasn't been circled or crossed out (3) and
again cross out all multiples of this number, etc. You only need to continue
until you reach the largest number whose square is less than or equal to $x$.

Apart from 2, prime numbers are never even. Apart from 2 and 5, prime numbers
never end in 2, 5 or 0. So you only need to consider numbers ending in 1, 3, 7,
9 anyway (there are infinite primes ending in these numbers; see \cite[vol. 1,
p. 137]{Tietze1973}).

You can now find a large number of finished programs on the Internet - often
complete with source code - allowing you to experiment with large numbers
yourself (see chapter \ref{spezialzahlentypen}). 
You also have access to large databases that contain either a large
number of primes or the factorisation of numerous composite numbers.

\subsection{Notes}
\paragraph{Proven statements / theorems about primes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item For each number $n$ in ${\bf N}$ there are $n$ consecutive natural
      numbers that are not primes.
      A proof of this can be found in \cite[p. 79]{Padberg1996}.
      
  \item Paul Erd\"os\footnote{%
           Paul Erd"os\index{Paul Erd""os}, Hungarian mathematician,
           Mar 26, 1913$-$Sep 20, 1996.
           }
      proved:
      Between each random number not equal to $1$ and its double, there is
      at least one prime. He was not the first to prove this theorem, but
      proved it in a much simpler manner than those before him.
      
  \item  \hypertarget{link-Primzahlfunktion-base-a-Proof}{}
      There is a real number a such that the function $f: {\bf N}
      \rightarrow {\mathbb Z}$ where $n \mapsto a^{3^n}$ 
      only delivers primes for all $n$ (see \cite[p. 82]{Padberg1996}).
      Unfortunately, problems arise when we try to determine $a$ 
      (\hyperlink{link-Primzahlfunktion-base-a-Offen}{see below}).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Unproven statements / conjectures about primes}\mbox{}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Christian Goldbach\footnote{%
      Christian Goldbach\index{Goldbach Christian}, German mathematician,
      Mar 18, 1690$-$Nov 20, 1764.
      }
      conjectured: Every even natural number greater than 2 can
      be represented as the sum of two prime numbers.
      Computers have verified\footnote{%
It is generally accepted today, that the Goldbach Conjecture is true, 
i.~e.\ valid for all even natural numbers bigger than $2$.
In 1999, mathematician J\"org Richstein from the computer sciences 
institute at the University of Giessen, studied even numbers up to 
400 billion and found no contradictory example (see
\href{http://www.informatik.uni-giessen.de/staff/richstein/de/Goldbach.html}
{\tt http://www.informatik.uni-giessen.de/staff/richstein/de/Goldbach.html}).
\index{Richstein 1999}
Nevertheless, this does not provide us with general proof.\\
The fact is that despite all efforts, Goldbach's conjecture has to date
not been proven. This leads one to believe that since the pioneer work of
the Austrian mathematician Kurt G\"odel \index{G\""odel Kurt} is 
well-known, not every true mathematical theorem is provable (see
\href{http://www.mathematik.ch/mathematiker/goedel.html}
{http://www.mathematik.ch/mathematiker/goedel.html}).
Perhaps Goldbach's conjecture was correct, but in any case the proof
will never be found. Conversely, that will presumably also remain unproven.}
      the Goldbach conjecture for all even numbers up to
      $4*10^{14}$ but no general proof has yet been found\footnote{%
The English publisher {\em Faber} and the American publisher {\em Bloomsbury}
issued in 2000 the 1992 published book ``Uncle Petros and Goldbach's 
Conjecture'' by Apostolos Doxiadis.
It's the story of an old maths professor who fails to prove a more than
250 year old puzzle. To boost the sales figures the English and American
publishers have offered a prize of 1 million USD, if someone can prove
the conjecture -- which should be published by 2004 in a well-known
mathematical journal.\\
Surprisingly only British and American citizens are allowed to participate.\\
The theorem which has come closest so far to Goldbach's conjecture
was proved by Chen Jing-Run in 1966 in a way which is somewhat hard
to understand:
Each even integer greater than $2$ is the sum of one prime and of 
the product of two primes. E.g.: $20=5+3*5.$\\
Most of the research about the Goldbach conjecture is collected in 
the book: ``Goldbach Conjecture'', ed. Wang Yuan, 1984, World scientific
Series in Pure Maths, Vol. 4.\\
Especially this conjecture makes it clear, that even today we do not
have a complete understanding of the deeper connections between addition and
multiplication of natural numbers.}.

  \item Bernhard Riemann\footnote{%
        Bernhard Riemann\index{Riemann Bernhard}, German mathematician,
        Sep 17, 1826$-$Jul 20, 1866.
        }
      put forward a formula for the distribution of primes
      that would further improve the estimate. However, this has neither
      been proved nor disproved so far.
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Open questions}\mbox{}\\
Twin primes are prime numbers whose difference is 2. Examples include 5 and 7 or
101 and 103. Triplet primes, however, only occur once: 3, 5, 7.  For all other
sets of three consecutive uneven numbers, one of them is always divisible by 3
and thus not a prime.
\begin{itemize}

\item The number of twin primes is an open question: infinite or limited
number?
  The largest twin primes known today are $1,693,965 \cdot 2^{66,443} \pm 1.$

\item Does a formula exist for calculating the number of twin primes per
interval?

\item \hypertarget{link-Primzahlfunktion-base-a-Offen}{}
    The \hyperlink{link-Primzahlfunktion-base-a-Proof}{above} proof of the
    function $f: \: N \rightarrow Z$ with $n \mapsto a^{3^n}$  
    only guarantees the existence of such a number $a$.  How can we
    determine this number $a$ and will it have a value, making the 
    function also of some practical interest?

\item Is there an infinite number of Mersenne prime numbers?\index{Prime number!Mersenne}\index{Mersenne!prime number}

\item Is there an infinite number of Fermat prime numbers?

  \item Does a polynomial\index{Polynomial} time algorithm exist for 
        calculating the prime factors of a number (see \cite[p. 167]{Klee1997})?
	This question can be divided into the three following questions:
   \begin{itemize} 
      \item Does a polynomial time algorithm exist that decides whether a
            number is prime? \\
	    This question has been answered by the AKS algorithm\index{AKS} 
	    (see chapter \ref{PrimesinP}, ``Primes in P'': 
	    Primality testing is polynomial).

      \item Does a polynomial time algorithm exist  that calculates for a
            composite number from how many prime factors it is made up 
	    (without calculating these factors)?

      \item Does a polynomial time algorithm exist that calculates for a
            composite number $n$ a non-trivial (i.e. other than $1$ and $n$)
	    factor of $n$?\footnote{Please compare chapters \ref{RSABernstein}
	    and \ref{NoteFactorisation}.}
   \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


At the end of chapter \ref{NoteFactorisation},
section \hyperlink{RSA-160-chap3}{RSA-160}
you can see the dimensions for which numbers the current algorithms deliver
results (test for primality\index{Primality testing}, 
factorization\index{Factorisation!factoring records}).


\paragraph{Further interesting topics regarding prime numbers}
\mbox{}\\
This chapter doesn't consider other number theory topics such as
divisibility rules, modulus calculation, modular inverses, modular powers and
roots, Chinese remainder theorem, Euler PHI function, perfect numbers.
Some of these are considered in the next chapter.

\subsubsection{Orders of magnitude / dimensions in reality}\label{s:grosord}
In the description of cryptographic protocols and algorithms, numbers occur that
are so large or so small that they are inaccessible to our intuitive
understanding. It may therefore be useful to provide comparative numbers from
the real world around us so that we can develop a feeling for the
security of cryptographic algorithms. Some of the numbers listed below originate
from \cite{Schwenk1996} and \cite[p.18]{Schneier1996p}.  \hypertarget{grosord}{}

    Only after I had completed this article, did I come across the 
    extremely well-written paper by Scott Aaronson, which also offers
    a didactically well done intoduction to this topic. It is 
    humorous and easy to read but at the same time precise and erudite.

\section{Paper and Pencil Encryption Methods}

\hypertarget{Kapitel_PaperandPencil}{}
\label{Kapitel_PaperandPencil}
(Christine St\"otzel, April 2004)

The following chapter provides a broad overview of paper and pencil 
methods\footnotemark
    \footnotetext{Always added with links to further information.}
    \index{Paper- and pencil methods}.
All techniques that people can apply manually to en- and decipher a message are 
embraced by this term. These methods were and still are especially popular with
secret services, as a writing pad and a pencil - in contrast to electronical
aids - are totally unsuspicious.

The first paper- and pencilmethods already arose about 3000 years ago, but new
procedures were developed during the past century, too. All paper and pencil 
methods are a matter of symmetric methods\index{Encryption!symmetric}. 
Even the earliest encryption algorithms use the basic principles such as 
transposition, substitution, block construction and their combinations. 
Hence it is worthwhile to closely consider this ''ancient'' methods especially
under didactic aspects.

xxxxxxxxxxErfolgreiche bzw. verbreiteter eingesetzte Verfahren mussten die gleichen 
Merkmale erf"ullen wie moderne Verfahren:
\begin{itemize}
\item xxxxxxxxxxxxxxVollst"andige Beschreibung, ja fast Standardisierung (incl. 
      Sonderf"alle, Padding, etc.).
\item xxxxxxxxxxGute Balance zwischen Sicherheit und Benutzbarkeit 
      (denn zu kompliziert zu bedienende Verfahren waren fehlertr"achtig
      oder unangemessen langsam).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Transposition}

Encrypting a message by means of transposition\index{Transposition} does not change the original characters of this
message, only their layout is modified.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Introductionary samples of different transposition ciphers}

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Railfence}\footnote{In CrypTool\index{CrypTool} 
   you can simulate this method under the menu {\bf Crypt \textbackslash{} 
   Symmetric (classic) \textbackslash{} Permutation}: for a railfence with
   2 lines use as key ''B,A'' and accept the default settings (only one
   permutation, where your input is done line-by-line and the ouput is
   taken column-by-column). 
   Using the key ''A,B'' "' would start the zigzag pattern below in the
   way, that the first letter is written into the first line instead of the
   second line.}
   \cite{Singh2001}%
   : 
   The characters of a message are alternately written in two (or more) lines,
   creating a zigzag pattern. The resulting cipertext is read out 
   line by line.\\
   This is more a children's method.

   historically -- grouped within blocks of 5 letters. It does not matter
   if the (constant) blocklength is different or no blank is inserted.}%

\item {\bf Scytale}\footnote{%
   The result of this encryption method meets the one of a simple columnar
   transposition.   
   In CrypTool\index{CrypTool} you can simulate this method under the 
   menu {\bf Crypt \textbackslash{} Symmetric (classic) \textbackslash{} 
   Permutation}: For the Scytale within the dialog box only the first 
   permutation is used. If the wood has e.g. 4 angles use as key ''1,2,3,4''.
   This is equivalent to write the text horizontally in blocks of 4 letters 
   in a matrix and to read it out vertically . 
   Because the key is in an in ascending order, the Scytale is denoted as
   an identical permutation; and because writing and read-out is done only
   once it is a simple (no double) permutation.}
   \cite{Singh2001}%
   : 
   This metod was probably used since more than 600 B.C. -- a description
   of how it operated is not known from before Plutarch (50-120 B.C.).\\
   A long strip of paper is wrapped around a wooden cylinder and the 
   message is written along the length of this strip. The ciphertext is 
   produced by unwinding the strip.

\item {\bf Grille} \cite{Goebel2003}: Both parties use identical stencils. 
   Line by line, their holes are filled with plaintext that is read out 
   column by column to produce the ciphertext. If there is plaintext left, 
   the procedure is repeated\footnote{%
   This method cannot be simulated with a pure column transposition.}.

\item {\bf Turning grille} \cite{Savard1999}: The German army used turning 
   grilles during WW1\footnote{The turning grille was already invented in 
   1881 by Eduard Flei"sner von Wostrowitz.\\
   A good visualization canbe found under www.turning-grille.com.}%
   . 
   A square grille serves as a stencil, a quarter of its fields being holes.
   The first part of the message is written on a piece of paper through	these
   holes, subsequently the grille is rotated by 90 degrees and the user can
   write down the second part of the message, etc. But this method does only
   work, if the holes are chosen carefully: Every field has to be used, and
   no field may be used twice, either. The ciphertext is read out line by line.

   In the example for a turning grille in the following table you can write
   4 times 16 characters of the cleartext on a piece of paper:
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|cccc|cccc|}
\hline 	
	O & - & - & - & - & O & - & - \\

Most of the following methods can be simulated in CrypTool\index{CrypTool} 
under the menu {\bf Crypt \textbackslash{} Symmetric (classic) 
\textbackslash{} Permutation}.}

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Simple columnar transposition} \cite{Savard1999}: First of all, 
   a keyword is chosen, that is written above the columns of a table. This
   table is filled with the text to be encrypted line by line. Then the 
   columns are rearranged by sorting the letters of the keyword alphabetically.
   Afterwards the columns are read out from left to right to build the 
   ciphertext\footnote{%
   Using CrypTool: Choose a key for the 1st permutation, input line by line, 
   permute and output column by column.}.

\end{table}

   Ciphertext: NALFA PIOAX PORSS IEMET NOTN\\

\item {\bf AMSCO} \cite{ACA2002}: The characters of the plaintext are written
   in alternating groups of one respectively two letters into a grille. 
   Then the columns are swapped and the text can be read out.

\item {\bf Double column transposition} \cite{09}: Double columnar transposition
   was frequently used during WW2 and during the Cold War. Two simple columnar
   transpositions with different keys are executed successively\footnote{%
   Using CrypTool: Choose a key for the 1st permutation, input line by line, 
   permute and output column by column. Then choose a (different) key for the
   2nd permutation, input line by line, permute and output column by column.}.
	
\item {\bf Column transposition, General Luigi Sacco} \cite{Savard1999}: The 
   columns of a table are numbered according to the letters of the keyword. 
   The plaintext is entered line by line, in the first line up to column 
   number one, in the second line up to column number two, etc. 
   Again, the ciphertext is read out in columns.

\item {\bf Column transposition, french army in WW1} 
   \cite{Savard1999}: 
   After executing a simple columnar transposition, diagonal rows are read out.


\item {\bf Row transposition cipher} \cite{02}: The plaintext is divided 
   into blocks of equal length and a keyword is chosen.
   Now the letters of the keyword are numbered and permutation is done only
   within each block according to this numbering\footnote{%
   Using CrypTool: Choose a key for 1st permutation, input line by line, 
   permute column by column and output line by line.}.

\end{itemize}


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Further transposition algorithms}

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Geometric figures} \cite{02}: Write the message into a grille 
   following one pattern and read it out using another.

\item {\bf Union route cipher} \cite{WP}: The union route cipher derives 
   from Civil War. This method does not rearrange letters of a given plaintext,
   but whole words. Particularly sensitive names and terms are substituted by 
   codewords which are recorded in codebooks together with the existing routes.
   A route determines the size of a grille and the pattern that is used to 
   read out the ciphertext. Aditionally, a number of filler words is defined.

\item {\bf Nihilist transposition} \cite{ACA2002}: Insert the plaintext into 
   a square grille and write the same keyword above the columns and next to
   the lines. As this keyword is sorted alphabetically, the contents of the
   grille are rearranged, too. Read out the ciphertext line by line.

\item {\bf Cadenus} \cite{ACA2002}: Cadenus is a form of columnar 
   transposition that uses two keywords.\\
   The 1st keyword is used to swap columns.\\
   The 2nd keyword is used to define the initial letter of each column:
   this 2nd keyword is a permutation of the used alphabet. This permutation
   is written on the left of the first column.
   Afterwards, each column is moved (wrap-around) so that it begins with the
   letter, which is in the the same line as the key letter of the first 
   keyword within the second keyword.\\
   Ciphertext is read out line by line.

\subsubsection{Monoalphabetic substitution}
Monoalphabetic substitution\index{Substitution!monoalphabetic} assigns one 
character of the ciphertext alphabet to each plaintext character. This mapping
remains unchanged during the whole process of encryption.

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Random pairs} \cite{Singh2001}: Substitution occurs by a given
   combination of letters.

\item {\bf Atbash} \cite{Singh2001}: Replace the first letter of the 
   alphabet by the last letter of the alphabet, the second one by the last 
   but one, etc.

\item {\bf Shift cipher, for example Caesar cipher}\footnote{In CrypTool
   this method  can be find at three different places in the menu tree:\\
   - {\bf Crypt \textbackslash{} Symmetric (classic) \textbackslash{} Caesar}\\
   - {\bf Analysis \textbackslash{} Symmetric Encryption (classic)
     \textbackslash{} Ciphertext only \textbackslash{} Caesar} \\
   - {\bf Indiv. Procedures \textbackslash{} Visualization of Algorithms 
     using ANIMAL \textbackslash{} Caesar}. } 
   \cite{Singh2001}%
   : Plaintext alphabet and ciphertext alphabet are shifted against each 
   other. Using the Caesar cipher means shifting letters about three positions.

	Plaintext:	three positions to the right\\

	Ciphertext:	WKUHH SRVLWLRQV WR WKH ULJKW\\

\item {\bf Substitution with symbols} \cite{Singh2001}, for instance the so-called''freemason cipher'': Each letter is replaced with a symbol.

\item {\bf Variants}: Fill characters, intentional mistakes \cite{Singh2001}.

\item {\bf Nihilist substitution}\footnote{An animation of this Nihilist method
   can be find in CrypTool at the menu item
     {\bf Indiv. Procedures \textbackslash{} Visualization of Algorithms 
     using ANIMAL \textbackslash{} Nihilist}. }
   \cite{ACA2002}: Insert the alphabet into a 5x5-matrix and replace 
   every letter of the message with the two corresponding digits. The 
   resulting numbers are written into a grille. For this purpose, a 
   keyword is chosen and placed above the columns of the grille. Its 
   letters are substituted by numbers, too. The ciphertext results from 
   adding the numbers of the plaintext and the numbers of the keyword.
   Numbers between 100 and 110 are transformed to numbers between 00 and
   10, so that each letter is represented by a two-digit number.

\item {\bf Coding} \cite{Singh2001}: In the course of time, codebooks were used again and again. A codebook assigns a codeword, a
	symbol or a number to every possible word of a message. Only if both parties hold identical codebooks and if the
	assignment of codewords to plaintext words is not revealed, a successful and secret communication can take place.

\item {\bf Nomenclature} \cite{Singh2001}: A nomenclature is an encryption system that is based upon a ciphertext alphabet. This
	alphabet is used to encrypt the bigger part of the message. Particularly frequent or top-secret words are replaced
	by a limited number of codewords existing besides the ciphertext alphabet.

\item {\bf Map cipher}: This method constitutes a combination of substitution and steganography\footnote{Instead of
	encrypting a message, pure steganography tries to conceal its existence.}. Plaintext characters are replaced by symbols
	which are arranged in a map following certain rules
	(see also: \href{http://library.thinkquest.org/27158/}{\texttt http://library.thinkquest.org/27158/}).

\item {\bf Straddling checkerboard} \cite{Goebel2003}. A 3x10-matrix is filled with the letters of the used alphabet and two
	arbitrary digits or special characters as follows: The different letters of a keyword and the remaining
	characters are written into the grille. The columns are numbered 0 to 9, the second and the third line are numbered
	1 and 2. Each plaintext character is replaced by the corresponding digit, respectively the corresponding pair of
	digits. As ''1'' and ''2'' are the first digits of the possible two-digit-numbers, they are not used as single
	digits. Besides, ''1'' and ''2'' are the most commonly used digits, but this feature is removed by the following
	technique.

        It is ostentatious, how often the numbers 1 and 1 appear,
        but this will be fixed with the following version.

\item {\bf Straddling checkerboard, variant} \cite{Goebel2003}: This variant of the straddling checkerboard was developed by sovjet
	spies during WW2. A grille is filled with the alphabet (number of columns = length of keyword), and two digits are
	chosen to indicate the second and third line of a 3x10-matrix (see above). Now the grille is traversed
	column by column: For a faster encryption, the eight most common letters (ENIRSATO) are assigned the digits from 0
	to 9, the reserved digits are not assigned. The remaining letters are provided with combinations of digits one after
	another and are inserted into the grille.

	letters. The last column is left out. Plaintext characters are substituted with numbers, the number of the last
	column is used to seperate words.
\item {\bf Baconian Cipher} \cite{ACA2002}: Assign a five-digit binary code to every letter and to 6 numbers or
	special characters (for example 00000 = A, 00001 = B, etc.) and replace the plaintext characters with this
	binary code. Now use a second, unsuspicious message to hide this code. This may happen by upper and lower

\subsubsection{Homophonic substitution}

Homophonic methods\index{Substitution!homophonic} constitute a special form of monoalphabetic substitution. Each
character of the plaintext alphabet is assigned several ciphertext characters.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Homophonic monoalphabetic substitution} \cite{Singh2001}: Each language has a typical frequency distribution of
	letters. To conceal this distribution, each plaintext letter is assigned several ciphertext characters. The
	number of ciphertext characters assigned depends on the frequency of the letter to be encrypted.
\item {\bf Beale cipher} \cite{Singh2001}: The Beale cipher is a book cipher that numbers the words of a keytext.
	These numbers replace the ciphertext letters corresponding to the words' initial letters.
\item {\bf Grandpré Cipher} \cite{Savard1999}: A square grille with 10 columns (other layouts are possible, too) is
	filled with ten words. The initial letters should result in an eleventh word. As columns and rows are
	numbered from 0 to 9, letters can be replaced by two-digit numbers. It is obvious that with the table having
	a hundred fields, most letters can be represented by more than one number. You should keep in mind that those
	ten words have to contain all letters of the plaintext alphabet.
\item {\bf Bookcipher}: The words of a message are substituted by triples ''page-line-position''. This method requires a
	detailed agreement of which book to use, especially regarding the edition (layout, error correction, etc.).
\end{itemize}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Polygraphic substitution}

Polygraphic techniques\index{Substitution!polygraphic} do not work by replacing single characters, but by replacing
whole groups of characters. In most cases, these groups are digramms, trigramms or syllables.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf ''Gro"se Chiffre''} \cite{Singh2001}: This cipher was used by Ludwig XIV. and was not solved until the end of the nineteenth
	century. Cryptograms consisted of 587 different numbers, every number representing a syllable. The inventors
	of the ''Gro"se Chiffre'' (Rossignol, father and son) constructed additional traps to increase security.
	For example, a number could assign a different meaning to or delete the preceding one.
\item {\bf Playfair} \cite{Singh2001}: A 5x5-matrix is filled with the plaintext characters. For example, the different
	letters of a keyword are inserted first, followed by the remaining letters. The plaintext is divided into
	pairs, these digraphs are encrypted using the following rules:

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item If both letters can be found in the same column, they are replaced by the letters
		underneath.
	\item If both letters can be found in the same row, take the letters to their right.
	\item If both letters of the digraph are in different columns and rows, the replacement letters are obtained
	by scanning along the row of the first letter up to the column where the other letter occurs and vice versa.
	\item Double letters are treated by special rules. They can be seperated by a filler, for example.
	\end{enumerate}

\item {\bf Trigraphic Playfair}: A 5x5-matrix is filled with the alphabet (see above) and the plaintext is divided into
	trigraphs. Trigraphs are encrypted according to the following rules:

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Three equal letters are substituted by three equal letters. It is the letter on the right underneath the
		original letter.
	\item A trigraph with two different letters is encrypted like a digraph in Playfair.
	\item If a trigraph contains three different characters, very complex rules come into effect.
		See \cite{Savard1999}
	\end{enumerate}
\item {\bf Substituting digraphs by symbols} \cite{Savard1999}: Giovanni Battista della Porta, 15th century. He created a
	20x20-matrix that contained one symbol for every possible combination of letters (his alphabet did not comprise
	more than twenty letters).
\item {\bf Four square cipher} \cite{Savard1999}: This method is similar to Playfair, because it is based on a system
	of coordinates whose four quadrants are each filled with the alphabet. The layout of letters can differ from
	quadrant to quadrant. To encipher a message, act in the following way: Look up the first plaintext letter in
	the first quadrant and the second one in the third quadrant. These two letters are opposite corners of a
	rectangle and the ciphertext letters can be found in quadrant number two and four.

\item {\bf Two square cipher} \cite{Savard1999}: The two square cipher resembles the four square cipher, but the matrix
	is reduced to two quadrants. Are both letters of the digraph part of the same row, they are just exchanged.
	Otherwise, the plaintext letters are considered as opposite corners of a rectangle and substituted by the other
	vertices. Quadrants can be arranged horizontal and vertical.
\item {\bf Tri square cipher} \cite{ACA2002}: Three quadrants are filled with the same alphabet. The first plaintext
	letter is looked up in the first quadrant and can be encrypted with every letter of that column. The second
	plaintext letter is looked up in the second quadrant (diagonally across) and can be encrypted with every letter
	of that row. Between theses two ciphertext characters, the letter at the intersection point is set.
\item {\bf Dockyard Cipher} \cite{Savard1999}: Used by the German navy during WW2.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Polyalphabetic substitution}

Concerning polyalphabetic substitution\index{Substitution!polyalphabetic}, the assignment of ciphertext characters to
plaintext characters is not static, but changes during the process of encryption (depending on the key).

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Vigen\`ere}  \cite{Singh2001}: Each plaintext character is encrypted with a different ciphertext alphabet
	that is determined by the characters of a keyword (the so-called Vigen\`ere-Tableau serves auxiliary means).
	If the plaintext is longer than the key, the latter is repeated.

\item {\bf Progressive key} \cite{Savard1999}: The key changes during the process of encryption. With every repetition,
	the characters of the keyword are shifted about one position. ''KEY'' becomes ''LFZ''.


\item {\bf Gronsfeld} \cite{Savard1999}: 
   Variant of Vigen\`ere that uses a numeric key.


\item {\bf Beaufort} \cite{Savard1999}: 
   Variant of Vigen\`ere, the key is subtracted, not added. The ciphertext 
   alphabets may be written backwards.


\item {\bf Porta} \cite{ACA2002}: Variant of Vigen\`ere with only 13 alphabets. As a consequence, two letters of the
	keyword are assigned the same ciphertext alphabet and the first and the second half of the alphabet are reciprocal.
\item {\bf Slidefair} \cite{ACA2002}: This method can be used as a variant of Vigen\`ere, Gronsfeld or Beaufort. Slidefair does
	encrypt digraphs according to the following rules:
	Look up the first letter in the plaintext alphabet above the tableau. Then look up the second one in the row
	belonging to the corresponding keyword letter. These two letters make up opposite corners of an imaginary
	rectangle. The letters at the two remaining corners substitute the digraph.
\item {\bf Superposition}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Book cipher}: A keytext (for example out of a book) is added to the plaintext.
	\item {\bf Superposition with numbers}: A sequence or a number of sufficient length (for example pi) is added.
	\end{itemize}
\item {\bf Philipps} \cite{ACA2002}: The alphabet is filled into a square table with 5 columns. Seven more tables are
	generated by first shifting the first row one position towards the bottom, then shifting the second row towards the
	bottom. The plaintext is divided into blocks of five which are encrypted with one matrix each. Letters are
	substituted by the ones on their right and underneath.
\item {\bf Ragbaby} \cite{ACA2002}: Construct an alphabet with 24 characters. Then number the plaintext characters, starting
	the numeration of the first word with ''1'', the numeration of the second one with ''2'' and so forth. Number 25
	corresponds to number 1. Each letter of the message is encrypted by shifting it the corresponding postions to
	the right.

\subsection{Combining substitution and transposition}

In the history of cryptography one often comes across combinations of the 
previous mentioned methods.

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf ADF(V)GX}\footnote{%
   In CrypTool\index{CrypTool} you can call this method under the menu
   {\bf Crypt \textbackslash{} Symmetric (classic) \textbackslash{} 
   ADFGVX}.}
   \cite{Singh2001}%
   : 
   ADFG(V)X-encryption was developed in Germany during WW1. The alphabet 
   is filled into a 5x5- or 6x6-matrix, and columns and rows are marked with
   the letters ADFGX and V, depending on the size of the grille. Each 
   plaintext character is substituted by the corresponding pair of letters. 
   Finally, a (row-) transposition cipher is performed on the resulting text.

\item {\bf Fractionation} \cite{Savard1999}: 
   Generic term for all kinds of methods that encrypt one plaintext character
   by several ciphertext characters and apply a transposition cipher to this
   ciphertext so that ciphertext characters originally belonging to each 
   other are separated.
   
   \begin{itemize}
      \item {\bf Bifid/Polybius square/checkerboard} \cite{Goebel2003}: 
         Bifid encryption is the basic form of fractionation. A 5x5-matrix 
         is filled with the plaintext alphabet (see Playfair encryption), 
         rows and columns are numbered. Now the plaintext is divided into 
         blocks of equal length and every character is transformed into a 
         pair of digits. Now all line numbers are read out first, followed 
         by all numbers naming the columns. To obtain the ciphertext, the 
         digits are transformed  in twos into letters again. Instead of 
         numbering rows and columns, a keyword can be used, too.

	\item {\bf Trifid} \cite{Savard1999}: 27 characters (alphabet + 1 special character) may be represented by a
		triple consisting of the digits 1 to 3. The message to be encrypted is divided into blocks of three and
		the relevant triple is written underneath each plaintext character as a column. The resulting numbers below
		the plaintext blocks are read out line by line and are substituted with the corresponding characters.
	\end{itemize}
\item {\bf Bazeries} \cite{ACA2002}: The plaintext alphabet is filled into a 5x5-matrix column by column,
	a second matrix is filled line by line with a keyword (a number smaller than a million) followed by the
	remaining letters of the alphabet. Then the message is divided into blocks of arbitrary length and their characters'
	order is inverted. Finally, each letter is substituted - according to its position in the original matrix -
	by its counterpart in the second matrix.

\item {\bf Digrafid} \cite{ACA2002}: To substitute digraphs, the following table is used (to simplify matters, the
	alphabet is used in its original form). Look up the first letter of the digraph in the horizontal alphabet and
	write down the column number. Then look up the second letter in the vertical alphabet and write down the
	corresponding line number. Between these two numbers, the number at the intersection point is set. Afterwards,
	the tripel are written vertically underneath the digraphs that are arranged in groups of three. The three digit
	numbers arising horizontally are transformed back into digraphs.

\subsection{Further methods}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf ''Pinprick encryption''} \cite{Singh2001}: For centuries, this simple encryption method has been put into
	practice for different reasons. During the Victorian Age, for example, small holes underneath letters in
	newspaper articles did mark the characters of a plaintext, as sending a newspaper was much more cheaper than
	the postage on a letter.
\item {\bf Stencil}: Stencils are also known as ''Cardinal-Richelieu-Key''. Sender and receiver have to agree upon a
	text. Above this text, a stencil is laid and the letters that remain visible make up the ciphertext.
\item {\bf Card games} \cite{Savard1999}: The key is created by means of a pack of cards and rules that are agreed upon
	in advance. All methods mentioned in this paragraph are designed as paper- and pencilmethods, i.e. they are
	applicable without electronical aid. A pack of cards is unsuspicious to outsiders, shuffling the deck provides
	a certain amount of coincidence, cards can be transformed into numbers easily and a transposition cipher can
	be carried out without any further aid.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Solitaire (Bruce Schneier)} \cite{Schneier1999}: A key is generated that has to consist of a many
	characters as the message to be encrypted. Encryption takes place by addition modulo 26. The
	algorithm to generate the key is based on shuffled deck of 54 cards (Ace, 2 - 10, jack, queen, king in
	four suits and two jokers). Sender and receiver have to own a deck of cards shuffled in the same manner.
	The pack of cards is held face up.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Swap the first joker with the card beneath it.
	\item Move the second joker two cards down.
	\item Now swap the cards above the first joker with those below the second one.
	\item Look at the bottom card and convert it into a number from 1 to 53 (bridge order of suits: clubs,
		diamonds, hearts, spades; joker = 53). Write down this number and count down as many cards starting with
		the top card. These cards are swapped with the remaining cards, only the bottom card remains untouched.
	\item Look at the top card and convert it into a number, too. Count down as many cards starting with the top
		card.
	\item Write down the following card. This card is converted into your first keystream character. As we need
		numbers from 1 to 26 to match the letters of our alphabet, clubs and hearts correspond to the numbers
		1 to 13, diamonds and spades to 14 to 26. If your output card is a jocker, start again.
	\end{enumerate}
	For each keystream character you like to generate, these six steps have to be carried out.
	\item {\bf Mirdek (Paul Crowley)} \cite{Crowley2000}: Even though this method is quite complicated, the author
	provides a very good example to illustrate the procedure.
	\item {\bf Playing Card Cipher (John Savard)} \cite{Savard1999}: This algorithm uses a shuffled deck of 52 cards
	(no joker). Separate rules describe how to shuffle the deck.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item The pack of cards lies in front of the user, top down. Cards are turned up and dealt out in a row until
		the total of the cards is 8 or more.
	\item If the last card dealt out is a J, Q or K, write down its value, otherwise write down the sum of the cards
		dealt out (a number between 8 and 17). In a second row, deal out that number of cards.
	\item The remaining cards are dealt out in rows under the second row. The first one ends under the lowest card
		of the top row, the second one under the next lowest card, and so on. If there are two identical cards,
		red is lower than black.
	\item The cards dealt out under step 3 are collected column by column, starting with the column under the lowest
		card. The first card that is picked up becomes the bottom card (face up).
	\item The cards dealt out in step 1 and 2 are picked up, beginning with the last card.
	\item The deck is turned over, the top card is now the bottom card (face down). Afterwards, steps 1 to 6 are
		repeated twice.
	\end{enumerate}
	To generate a keystream character, write down the first card not being J, Q or K. Count down that number of
	cards. The card selected has to be between 1 and 10. Now repeat these steps beginning with the last card.
	These two numbers are added and the last digit of the sum is your keystream character.
	\end{itemize}
\item {\bf VIC cipher} \cite{Savard1999}: This is a highly complicated but relatively secure paper- and pencilmethod.
	It has been developed and applied by Sovjet spies. Amongst other things, the user had to create ten pseudo-random
	numbers out of a date, the first words of a sentence and any five-digit number. A straddling checkerboard is part
	of the encryption, too. A detailed description can be found under \cite{Savard1999}.
\end{itemize}

\noindent In this CrypTool\index{CrypTool} script you will find predominantly
mathematically oriented information on using cryptographic procedures.
The main chapters have been written by various
{\bf authors} (see appendix \ref{s:appendix-authors})
%\hyperlink{appendix-authors}{authors}
and are therefore independent from one another. At the end of most chapters
you will find literature and web links.

The \hyperlink{Kapitel_1}{first chapter} explains the principles of symmetric
and asymmetric {\bf encryption} and describes shortly the current decryption
records of modern symmetric algorithms.

Because of didactical reasons the \hyperlink{Kapitel_PaperandPencil}
{second chapter} gives an exhaustive overview
about {\bf paper and pencil encryption methods}.

Big parts of this script are dedicated to the fascinating topic of 
{\bf prime numbers} (chap. \ref{Label_Kapitel_2}).
%\hyperlink{Kapitel_2}{{\bf prime numbers}}. 
Using numerous examples,
{\bf modular arithmetic} and 
{\bf elementary number theory} (chap. \ref{Chapter_ElementaryNT})
are introduced and applied in an exemplary manner for the {\bf RSA procedure}.

By reading chapter \ref{Chapter_ModernCryptography}
you'll gain an insight into the mathematical ideas and concepts behind 
{\bf modern cryptography}.

%A \hyperlink{Chapter_Hashes-and-Digital-Signatures}{further chapter}
Chapter \ref{Chapter_Hashes-and-Digital-Signatures} gives
an overview about the status of attacks against modern {\bf hash algorithms}
and is then shortly devoted to {\bf digital signatures}, 
which are an essential component of e-business applications.

The \hyperlink{ellcurve}{last chapter} describes {\bf elliptic curves}:
they could be used as an alternative to RSA and in addition are extremely
well suited for implementation on smartcards.

Whereas the \textit{eLearning program} CrypTool\index{CrypTool} motivates and
teaches you how to use cryptography in practice, the \textit{script} provides
those interested in the subject with a deeper understanding of the mathematical
algorithms used -- trying to do it in an instructive way.
If you are alrady a little bit familiar with this field of knowledge you can
gain a fast overview about the functions delivered by CrypTool using the
{\bf menu tree} (see appendix \ref{s:appendix-menutree}).

As with the eLearning program CrypTool\index{CrypTool}, the quality of the 
script is enhanced by your suggestions and ideas for improvement. 
We look forward to your feedback.

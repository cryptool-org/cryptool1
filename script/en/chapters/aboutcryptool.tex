In this CrypTool\index{CrypTool} script you will find predominantly
mathematically oriented information on using cryptographic procedures.
The main chapters have been written by {\em various authors} and are
therefore independent from one another. At the end of most chapters
you will find literature and web links.

You will find information about the principles of symmetrical and
asymmetrical {\bf encryption}. A large section of the script is dedicated
to the fascinating topic of {\bf prime numbers}. Using numerous examples,
the {\bf elementary number theory} and {\bf modular arithmetic} are
introduced and applied in an exemplary manner to the {\bf RSA procedure}.
After this, one receives insight into the mathematical ideas behind
{\bf modern cryptography}. 

%You will also obtain an overview of the
%mathematical ideas behind modern cryptography.

A further chapter is devoted to {\bf digital signatures}, 
which are an essential component of e-business applications. 
The last chapter describes {\bf elliptic curves}: they could be used
as an alternative to RSA they are extremely well suited for 
implementation on smartcards.

Whereas the program CrypTool\index{CrypTool} teaches you how to use
cryptography in practice, the script provides those interested in the
subject with a deeper understanding of the mathematical algorithms
used -- trying to do it didactically as well as possible.

The {\em authors} Bernhard Esslinger, Matthias B\"uger, Bartol Filipovic, 
Henrik Koy, Roger Oyono and J\"org-Cornelius Schneider
would like to take this opportunity to thank their colleagues 
in the company and at the universities of Frankfurt, Gie\ss en, 
Siegen and Karlsruhe. They particularly thank Dr. Peer Wichmann
from the Karlsruhe computer science research centre
(Forschungszentrum Informatik, FZI) for his down-to-earth support.

As at CrypTool\index{CrypTool}, the quality of the script is enhanced
through your suggestions and ideas for improvement. We look forward 
to your feedback.

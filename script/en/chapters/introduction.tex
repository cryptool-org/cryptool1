\chapter*{Preface to the 10th Edition of the CrypTool Script}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface to the 10th Edition of the CrypTool Script}

Starting in the year 2000 this script became part of the 
CrypTool\index{CrypTool} package. It is designed to accompany the program 
CrypTool by explaining some mathematical topics in more detail, 
but still in a way which is easy to understand.

In order to also enable developers/authors to work together independently 
the topics have been split up and for each topic an extra chapter has been 
written which can be read on its own. The later editorial work in TeX added 
cross linkages between different sections and footnotes describing where you
can find the according functions within the CrypTool\index{CrypTool} 
program \hyperlink{appendix-menutree}{(see menu tree in appendix A).}

Naturally there are many more interesting topics in mathematics and
cryptography which could be discussed in greater depth -- therefore this
is only one of many ways to do it.

The rapid spread of the Internet has also lead to intensified research in the
technologies involved, especially within the area of cryptography where a good
deal of new knowledge has arisen.

%This edition of the script adds some topics, but mainly updates areas (e.g. the
%summaries of topical research areas):
Again this edition of the script corrected, amended and updated some topics, e.g.:
\vspace{-7pt}
\begin{itemize}
  \item the search for the largest prime numbers, 
%  \item progress in cryptanalysis of hash algorithms 
%        (chap. \ref{collision-attacks-against-sha-1}) and
%  \item progress in ideas for new crypto methods (RSA successor) 
%        (chap. \ref{xxxxxxxxxBrute-force-gegen-Symmetr})\index{xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx} and
  \item the list of movies or novels, in which cryptography or number theory 
        played major role (see appendix \ref{s:appendix-movies});
        and where primes are used as hangers  
        (see curiouses in \ref{HT-Quaint-curious-Primes-usage}).
\end{itemize}

Newly added is the appendix about using the computer algebra system
Sage (see \ref{s:appendix-using-sage}). This was added because Sage becomes
more and more the standard open-source CAS system. Accordingly all
samples written before in PARI-GP and Mathematica have been substituted
with Sage code. Thanks to Minh Van Nguyen a lot of new code samples could be added.

The first time the document was delivered with CrypTool\index{CrypTool} 
was in version 1.2.01. Since then it has been expanded and revised in almost
every new version of CrypTool.

I am deeply grateful to all the people helping with their impressive
commitment who have made this global project so successful.
Thanks also to the readers who sent us feedback.
% Especially I would like to acknowledge the English language proof-reading
% of this script version done by Richard Christensen and Lowell Montgomery.

I hope that many readers have fun with this script and that they get 
out of it more interest and greater understanding of this modern but 
also very ancient topic.

\textbf{This script}

This document is delivered together with the program CrypTool\index{CrypTool}.
\par \vskip + 3pt

The articles in this script are largely self-contained and
can also be read independently of CrypTool\index{CrypTool}.

Chapters  \ref{Chapter_ModernCryptography} (Modern Cryptography) and 
\ref{Chapter_EllipticCurves} (Elliptic Curves) require a deeper knowledge
in mathematics, while the other chapters should be understandable with a 
school leaving certificate.

The authors
% \hyperlink{appendix-authors}{(authors)}
% in \ref{s:appendix-authors}
% \hypertarget{appendix-authors}{}\label{s:appendix-authors}
have attempted to describe cryptography for a broad 
audience -- without being mathematically incorrect. We believe that this
didactic pretension is the best way to promote the awareness for IT
security and the readiness to use standardized modern cryptography.
\par \vskip + 15pt


\textbf{The program CrypTool\index{CrypTool}}

CrypTool\index{CrypTool} is an educational program with a comprehensive online
help enabling you to use and analyse cryptographic procedures within a
unified graphical user interface.\par \vskip + 3pt

CrypTool\index{CrypTool} is currently been used for 
training in companies and teaching at school and universities, and
moreover several universities are helping to further develop the project.
\par \vskip + 15pt


\textbf{Acknowledgment}

At this point I'd like to thank explicitly the following people who
particularly contributed to CrypTool\index{CrypTool}. They applied their
very special talents and showed really great engagement:

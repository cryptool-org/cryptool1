This script is delivered together with CrypTool.

CrypTool is a program with an extremely comprehensive online help enabling you
to use and analyse cryptographic procedures.\par \vskip + 3pt

For the conventional encryption procedures, automatic analyses are available in CrypTool
that enable you to determine the key with knowledge of the encrypted document
and, possibly, further information (non-encrypted document or language of the
document).\par \vskip + 3pt

CrypTool was developed during the End-User Awareness program in order to
increase employee awareness of IT security and provide them with a deeper
understanding of the term security.\par \vskip + 3pt

A further aim was to enable users to understand the cryptographic procedures
implemented in the Deutsche Bank. In this way, using CrypTool as a reliable
reference implementation of the various encryption procedures (because of using the industry-proven SECUDE Library),
you can test the encryption implemented in other programs. \par \vskip + 3pt

Because the articles in this script are largely self-contained, this script can also
be read independantly of CrypTool.

The {\em authors} tried to describe cryptography for a broad audience --
without being mathematically incorrect. We believe, that this didactical pretention
is the way to promote the awareness for IT security and the readiness to use standardised modern cryptography.

Cryptographic applications -- classical as well as modern ones -- have been
used in literature and movies. In some media they are only mentioned and
are a pure admixture; in others they play a primary role and are explained
in detail; and sometimes the purpose of the story, which forms the framework,
is primarily to transport this knowledge and achieve better motivation.
Here is the beginning of an overview.

    {\em The Gold Bug}, 1843.\footnote{%
        See \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gold-Bug}.

	Part 1 of the series {\em RSA \& Co. at school: Modern cryptology,
        old mathematics, and subtle protocols} contains a didactical description
	for usage at school.
	Unfortunately this series is currently only available in German.
        See \cite{Witten1998}, pp 52 ff (``Das Gold des Gehenkten'').
	\index{RSA \& Co. at school}

	All material about a gold-bug lesson (double period) can be found at
	\url{http://www.informatik-im-kontext.de/} via
	``E-Mail (nur?) für Dich'' => ``Vertraulichkeit mit Verschlüsselungsverfahren''.

	Poe not only was a well-known writer, but also a talented cryptographer.
	His story is also told in the book {\em Code Breaking} \cite{Kippenhahn1997}.
    }\\
    In this short story Poe tells as first-person narrator about his
    acquaintanceship with the curious Mr. Legrand. They detect the fabulous
    treasure of captain Kidd via a gold bug and a vellum found at the coast
    of New England.\\
    The cipher consists of 203 cryptic symbols and it proves to be a
    general monoalphabetic substitution cipher (see
    chapter~\ref{monoalphabeticSubstitutionCiphers}).
    The story tells how they solve the riddle step by step using a combination
    of semantic and syntax analysis (frequency analysis of single letters in
    English texts).\footnote{
      Part of the learning material above is a Python\index{Python} program which can be used
      to decrypt the ciphertext with Python {\em and} with SageMath\index{SageMath}.
      See the code example in \ref{s:appendix-Code-for-light-fiction-books}.
    }\\
    In this novel the code breaker Legrand says the famous statement:
    ``Yet it may be roundly asserted that human ingenuity cannot concoct a
    cipher which human ingenuity cannot resolve -- given the according
    dedication.''\\

    {\em Mathias Sandorf}, 1885. \\
    This is one of the most famous novels of the French author Jules Verne
    (1828-1905), who was called ``Father of Science fiction''.\\
    In ``Mathias Sandorf'' he tells the story of the freedom fighter Earl
    Sandorf, who is betrayed to the police, but finally he can escape.\\
    The whistle-blowing worked, because his enemies captured and decrypted
    a secret message sent to him. For decryption they needed a special
    grille, which they stole from him. This turning grille was a quadratic
    piece of jig with 6x6 squares, of which 1/4 (nine) were holes
    (see the \hyperlink{turning-grille-cipher}{turning grille} in 
    chapter~\ref{introsamplesTranspositionCiphers}).\\

    and in ``Kim'' we find The Great Game: espionage and spying.  Within the
    first twenty pages we have authentication by something you have, denial
    of service, impersonation, stealth, masquerade, role-based
    authorization (with ad hoc authentication by something you know),
    eavesdropping, and trust based on data integrity.  Later on we get
    contingency planning against theft and cryptography with key changes.''\\

    In this Sherlock Holmes short story (first published in 1903 in the
    ``Strand Magazine'', and then in 1905 in the collection 
    ``The Return of Sherlock Holmes'' the first time in book-form)
    Sherlock Holmes has to solve a cipher which at first glance looks
    like a harmless kid's picture. \\
    But it proves to be the monoalphabetic substitution cipher (see
    chapter~\ref{monoalphabeticSubstitutionCiphers}) of the criminal Abe
    Slaney.
    Sherlock Holmes solves the riddle using frequency analysis.\\

    personality characteristics are involuntarily placed in an kafkaesque maze
    of cubical rooms containing deadly traps.\\
    To get out the persons have to move through these rooms. To find out
    which rooms are dangerous, mathematics is crucial: Each cubic room has
    at its entrance a numerical marking consisting of three sets of three
    digits. First they deduce that all rooms marked at their entrance with
    at least one prime number are trapped. Later it comes out that a trapped
    room can also be marked by a number which is a power of a prime (so 
    traps are $p^n$, e.g. $128=2^7$ or $101 = 101^1 = prime$, but not

    Dan Brown's first novel was published in 1998 as e-book, but it was
    largely unsuccessful then.\\
    The National Security Agency (NSA) uses a huge computer, which enables it
    to decrypt all messages (needless to say only of criminals and terrorists)
    within minutes even if they use the most modern encryption methods.\\
    An apostate employee invents an unbreakable code and his computer program
    Diabolus forces the super computer to do self destructing operations.
    The plot, where also the beautiful computer expert Susan Fletcher has a
    role, is rather predictable.\\
    The idea, that the NSA or another secret service is able to decrypt any
    code, is currently a popular topic. % popular on several authors:
    In ``Digital Fortress'' the super computer has 3 million processors -- 
    nevertheless from today's view this is by no means sufficient to hack
    modern ciphers.\\

\item[\textrm{[Stephenson1999]}] \index{Stephenson 1999}
    Neal Stephenson, \\
    {\em Cryptonomicon}, Harper, 1999. \\
    This very thick novel deals with cryptography both in WW2 and today.
    The two heroes from the 40ies are the excellent mathematician and
    cryptanalyst Lawrence Waterhouse, and the overeager and 
    morphine addicted US marine Bobby Shaftoe. 
    They both are members of the special allied unit 2702, which tries
    to hack the enemy's communication codes and at the same time to
    hide the own existence. \\
    This secretiveness also happens in the present plot, where the 
    grandchildren of the war heroes -- the dedicated programmer  
    Randy Waterhouse and the beautiful Amy Shaftoe -- team up. \\
    Cryptonomicon is notably heavy for non-technical readers in parts.
    Several pages are spent explaining in detail some of the concepts
    behind cryptography.
    Stephenson added a detailed description of the Solitaire cipher
    (see chapter~\ref{Further-PaP-methods}), a paper and pencil encryption

    Douglas Preston, \\
    {\em Tyrannosaur Canyon}, Forge Books, 2005. \\
    A very exciting thriller which also struggles with the question why the dinosaurs
    died off.

    Archeologist Stem Weathers is shot in a canyon. Before his murderer appears he
    gives his notebook to Tom Broadbent, a local animal doctor, coming by accidentally.
   
    The notebook contains on 60 pages only digits. Therefore Tom takes it to Wyman Ford
    an ex-CIA cryptanalyst, who now lives in a nearby abbey, after his wife was killed
    in action.
    Wyman first declines and says that self-invented code are ``idiot ciphers'' -- devised
    by an idiot and easily crackable by each idiot. The notebook then proves to be not
    that easy. After intensive analysis he finds out that the digits are no code but the
    output of an earth radar device showing the picture of a well-preserved T.rex.

    After around 250 pages of endless chases a surprising turn comes up: Masago, head
    of a so-called black-detachment unit of the CIA. He explains: New weapons
    invented once always have been used. Mankind will kill herself, but its his task
    to postpone that as far as possible. As head of the LS480 department he will prevent
    by any means possible that terrorists get any new dangerous biological weapon.

    When scanning the dead body of Weathers the murder only found some rock cuttings
    he took. These rocks are investigated by a young reseacher named Melody Crookshank
    although she doesn't know where the rock cuttings come from. She finds within

    A history-based thriller with some artificially constructed elements, dealing
    also with a treasure hunt to get the hidden uranium of the nazis, and
    naturally the future of the world depends on today's bad guys being stopped in time ...

    Heros are Tom Kirk, a London-based ex-CIA agent and former professional art thief,
    and Dominique de Lecourt, who loves challenges including riddles and codes.

    The only cryptographic parts are a ``Sprungcode'' (the criminals use this method to
    communicate via newsletter adverts), steganography (used to hide the Enigma key),
    and an Enigma message (containing the encrypted coordinates of the treasure).

    At the beginning of the plot an Enigma device is stolen with high efforts
    which is necessary to let the story play in the constructed way. But in the
    reality today such a theft is completely needless, as there are great software
    emulators for the Enigma ... \\

    Because Merrit assumed that his programme will be misused, he installed a
    trapdoor: If a party with the name VWM participates at the election,
    it automatically gets 95 \% of the votes ...\\
    The fictional story line is based on many verifiable and well researched
    facts, which are referenced in footnotes.\\
    While the cryptographic protocols itself could be made secure,
    their implementation and their organisational management stays susceptible

    The plot exposes the vulnerability of modern computer based identity, authenticity,
    and security interweaving modern cryptography with classical art and literature.
    Cryptographer and classicist Ambrose Jerusalem is a UC Berkeley graduate
    with a beautiful girlfriend and a comfortable future, until the NSA recruits him
    to track a strange pattern of computer break-ins. Many small pieces provide
    disturbing evidence that someone has broken RSA encryption. Even more bizarre,
    a secret cult of latter-day followers of Pythagoras, the great Greek mathematician
    and philosopher who believed reality could be understood only through a mystical
    system of numbers, appears to be behind the attacks.\\

    Daniel Suarez, \\
    {\em Daemon}, Penguin Books, 2009, 632 pages. \\
    This is considered as one of the most exciting books during the last few years -- its a
    near-science-fiction thriller combining developments in the real world and possibilities
    coming from current research like from the Google X Lab (augmented reality
    head-mounted displays (HMD) like Google glass, self-driving cars, 3-D printers, ...)
    to a plausible story.

    After the computer genius and game developer Matthew Sobol died a daemon starts
    acting in the internet, which seemingly ruthless manipulates and trains more and more
    humans and companies.

    By ruling the data everybody seems to be a helpless victim. All the communication
    of his mercenary soldiers is affected by high-tech and encryption -- also the
    communication between the distributed instances of his incarnation. Core is an MMORPG
    game (massive multiplayer online role-playing game) which reminds many of WoW. Here also
    encryption is used, e.g. to advertise the best players: m0wFG3PRCoJVTs7JcgBwsOXb3U7yPxBB

    The plot is without redudancy, complex, manifold, very fascinating and with it
    critics about the plutocrats it also contains concrete social elements.
    The end is open. And the ideas seem to be realizable in the very next future ...\\

    Daniel Suarez, \\
    {\em Freedom (TM)}, Penguin Books, 2010, 486 pages. \\
    ``The propulsive, shockingly plausible sequel to the bestseller Daemon'' (see above).
    Freedom (TM) (Daemon \#2) patches a number of holes the writer left in the first book.
    The prose is tighter, the descriptions more direct, the characters are fleshed out,
    especially Loki.
    Having laid the groundwork in ``Daemon'', Suarez uses this
    foundation in order to explore a new concept of social organization based on empowering
    information technology and the reasoning why and how the battle runs between the old
    potentates and the Daemon society, which also evolves further already during the story.
    Cryptography is a natural part of modern technology and modern warfare as described
    in this book.
    The new society emerging in ``Freedom (TM)'' is based on the darknet, an alternative to
    the internet using fast wireless meshes in order to increase the durability and
    availability of the network. Despite the story is shocking in some parts, it appears to
    be realistic and not far away from the parallel usage of modern technology integrated
    into our modern lives as a virtual world overlaying our real world.\\

    So he still has something that reminds him of his brother. \\
    But this computer system is also interesting for the military. One day Michael's
    father is kidnapped and the company and thus also the computer program Rafael 2.0

    Michael is banished by his uncle in a boarding school, from which he can flee.
    Henceforth, Michael and his friends try their best to find his father, of whom
    they assume that he was abducted by a competing company. From here the
    story gets really exciting ...
    Michael learns that there is another artificial intelligence, Metraton,
    which is not so well-disposed to the people.

\noindent Chapter \ref{s:Light-fiction-for-grownups} lists as first book
``The Gold Bug'' by E.A. Poe.\index{Poe 1843}

Using the following Python\index{Python} code\footnote{%
  See \cite{Witten1998} and the file \verb|2_MonoKidd.zip| at
  \url{http://bscw.schule.de/pub/bscw.cgi/159132}.
}
you can decrypt the ciphertext of Captain Kidd (see the original text of
``The Gold Bug'' in \url{http://pinkmonkey.com/dl/library1/gold.pdf},
page 21) with Python or with SageMath\index{SageMath}.

The code already contains the ascii characters of the ciphertext and the
correlated alphabets for the plaintext and the ciphertext of this
monoalphabetic cipher.

The easiest way to perform the decryption is using the SageMathCell server
(\url{http://sagecell.sagemath.org/}) in a browser:
There you can switch between the programming languages Sage and Python.
The code can be executed by insering it with ``copy and paste'' and
then pressing ``Evaluate''.\\

\end{Verbatim}
\caption{Decryption of the Gold-Bug ciphertext from the novel of E.A. Poe (with Python\index{Python})}
\label{Lit_Python-sample_Gold-bug}
\end{sagecode}

\paragraph*{Remark 1:}
When printing the ciphertext of Poe, Pinkmonkey ``cheated'' similarly like
the code author by using only ascii characters.

In the archive of an original publication (e.g. at
\url{https://archive.org/details/goldbug00poegoog} at page 95) you can see,
that Poe used characters which were common in the letterpress printing 
(and most of them are also part of the ascii set). It is very unlikely
that an untaught pirate would use just such characters for his ciphertext ...

\paragraph*{Remark 2:}
The code uses the Python\index{Python} functions ``maketrans'' und ``translate'' from the
String package (see e.g. the Python 2.7 documentation, section ``functions'').

So both alphabets (for the plaintext and the ciphertext) are inserted as a simple
string, and ``maketrans'' creates a mapping table. The actual encryption
is done by ``translate''. For the decryption you just have to switch the
arguments of ``maketrans'' for the two alphabets.
The otherwise necessary transformations between characters and their ascii numbers
(using ``str'' and ``ord'') can be avoided. This is ideal for
monoalphabetic ciphers -- especially for lessons at the junior high school.


\paragraph*{Remark 3:}
The following screenshot shows the execution of the Python\index{Python} code on the SageMathCell
server (\url{http://sagecell.sagemath.org/}).

SageMathCell is the browser interface for Sage. Its functions are delivered for free
on the Sage cell server (Sage is a comprehensive open-source math software system).

\noindent It's evident how less code is needed with Python\index{Python} or Sage for such tasks.
In the above sample there were 2 unnecessary comment lines, 3 lines for input,
3 lines of real code, and 3 lines for the output; really necessary were only
7 lines of code.

\section{Learning Tool for Elementary Number Theory}
    \label{s:appendix-Learn-NT}  
    \index{NT, Learning Tool for Number Theory}%
    \index{educational tool NT}%

CT1\index{CT1} contains an interactive educational tool for elementary
{\em number theory}, called ``NT''.\footnote{%
    NT can be called in CT1\index{CT1} via the menu path
    {\bf Indiv. Procedures \textbackslash{} Number Theory Interactive
    \textbackslash{} Learning Tool for Number Theory}.
}

The educational tool ``NT'' (number theory) by Martin Ramberger introduces
number theory and visualizes many of the methods and concepts.
Where necessary it show the according mathematical formulas.
Often you can apply the mathematical methods dynamically with your own small
numerical examples.

The content of this educational tool is mainly based on the books by
J.\ Buchmann and H.\ Scheid \cite{Buchmann2016, Scheid2006}.

This visualized educational tool was build with Authorware 4.\footnote{%
    As Authorware is outdated and as the vendor didn't make tools available
    to easily port it to his successor products, the program ZT will not be
    further developed.
}


\paragraph*{Request for enhancement/upgrade:}
It would be desirable to update it to a new version Authorware or to use
another development platform. If there are developers interested to do
this, I'd be more than happy (please send an email at the author of this
CrypTool script).
